    NARRATOR: Shae's meticulous investigation, conducted through established channels and carefully worded reports, exposes ColCorp's negligence. Lumina RRM, acting on her findings, pressures Coldry's government to implement stricter quality control, averting immediate disaster.  The crisis is contained, at least for now.  She feels a brief moment of relief, a small victory within the system she strives to protect.

    NARRATOR: Shae's efforts to expose ColCorp's actions are stymied by Lumina RRM's internal resistance.  Her superiors, possibly influenced by unseen forces, dismiss her concerns as overblown or even actively sabotage her investigation. Coldry continues to send subpar canisters, exacerbating the sun's instability.  The fear of repercussions for challenging the established order outweighs her concern for the truth. The anxiety sheâ€™s been trying to manage intensifies, and she begins to question her own ability to effectively influence the situation.
    # IMAGE: Shae hunched over her desk in her dimly lit office, surrounded by discarded reports and files. Her face is etched with worry and defeat, a single tear tracing a path down her cheek. The flickering sunlight outside casts long, ominous shadows.
