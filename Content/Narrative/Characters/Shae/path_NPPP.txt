NARRATOR: The artificial sun sputters, casting long, flickering shadows across Lumina's usually pristine streets. Shae feels the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.

TOKEN_CHALLENGE_START
  ACTION_TO_ATTEMPT_TEXT: "Shae will leverage her influence within the Lumina RRM to secretly expedite a shipment of vital exotope canisters to Sun Island, bypassing the usual bureaucratic delays.  She'll frame it as an emergency measure approved by a high-ranking official, forging documents if necessary, and using her contacts to ensure minimal disruption or detection.  Failure will mean severe consequences, exposing her actions and potentially jeopardizing her standing within the system. Success offers a small chance to stabilize the situation and maintain the system’s stability."
