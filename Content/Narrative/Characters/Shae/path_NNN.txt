    NARRATOR: Shae's attempts to subtly investigate are met with resistance and obfuscation.  Her anxieties about rocking the boat prevent her from pushing too hard for answers, and her superiors dismiss her concerns as unfounded paranoia, furthering her sense of helplessness and reinforcing her reliance on existing systems despite their flaws.  The logistical inefficiencies continue, masked by carefully crafted misinformation.
    # IMAGE: Shae sits alone in her office, surrounded by piles of contradictory reports, her face etched with worry and frustration.  The dim light from the failing sun casts elongated shadows, accentuating her isolation.
