  ACTION_TO_ATTEMPT_TEXT: "Shae will convene a closed-door meeting with key figures within Lumina RRM and select loyalist council members.  The goal is to subtly shift blame for the delays onto Coldry's failing canister production, while simultaneously securing assurances of Lumina's continued adherence to protocol and prioritizing essential sun-related shipments to maintain appearances of stability and deflect any potential accusations of sabotage."

The meeting concludes with renewed pledges of loyalty and a plan to publicly condemn Coldry's negligence.

Shae's carefully constructed facade of control begins to crack under the weight of mounting suspicion.  The carefully laid plans fall apart.  The growing unease within Lumina's governing body intensifies, fueled by anxiety about the declining sun.
