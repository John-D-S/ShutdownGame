    NARRATOR: The Minister, initially resistant, is swayed by Shae's carefully constructed argument emphasizing the danger of escalating automaton intervention and the potential for chaos if Lumina's image is tarnished.  A swift investigation is launched, leading to adjustments in logistics.

    NARRATOR: The Minister dismisses Shae's concerns, accusing her of spreading fear and undermining Lumina RRM.  Shae's carefully constructed arguments are misconstrued; her evidence is deemed insufficient, and the Minister even suspects her of disloyalty. Shae is publicly reprimanded.
