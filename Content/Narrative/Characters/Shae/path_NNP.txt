  ACTION_TO_ATTEMPT_TEXT: "To quell rising anxieties and maintain Lumina's stability, Shae will convene a closed-door meeting with key figures in Lumina's RRM and government, focusing on reaffirming established procedures and addressing the automaton warnings through the lens of Lumina's interests and established protocols.  The goal is to present the situation as a manageable logistical challenge, not a planetary crisis requiring radical change, and to reinforce the importance of loyalty and adherence to the existing system."
