NARRATOR: Shae, perched at her polished mahogany desk in the Lumina Government Building, sips lukewarm tea, her gaze flitting between the official government intranet and the subtle dimming of the artificial sun outside her window.  A report on the delayed Sun Island shipment sits unopened, the anxiety building in her chest a familiar weight.

    NARRATOR: Minister Theron, already overwhelmed by unrelated political pressures, brushes aside Shae's concerns, assuring her that the delay is a minor issue and Lumina RRM is handling the situation appropriately.  She refuses a meeting and dismisses Shae's anxieties as overblown, leaving Shae feeling more anxious and uncertain than ever.
