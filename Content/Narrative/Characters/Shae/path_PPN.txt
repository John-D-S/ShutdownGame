    NARRATOR: Shae's anxieties leak into her presentation.  Her pleas sound weak and uncertain, and her warnings about external threats are dismissed as fear-mongering or an attempt to consolidate power.  The council, already wary of the automatons' demands, sees this as an opportunity to further obstruct their efforts, strengthening their own power.
    # IMAGE: Shae, looking defeated and small, stands before a disinterested council. The council members are engaged in side conversations, ignoring her presentation. The atmosphere is cold and dismissive.
