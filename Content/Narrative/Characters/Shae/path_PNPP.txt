    NARRATOR: Minister Theron, initially skeptical, is swayed by Shae's detailed evidence and the gravity of the situation. He orders an immediate investigation and publicly reprimands the RRM, initiating emergency measures to expedite exotope delivery.

    NARRATOR: Minister Theron dismisses Shae's concerns, viewing her actions as insubordination and a threat to Lumina's carefully managed image. He silences her report, subtly using the crisis to further consolidate his power and blame the automatons for the failing sun, while privately ordering the RRM to discreetly continue their obstructive tactics.  Shae is left isolated, her anxiety escalating into paralyzing fear.
