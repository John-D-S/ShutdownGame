NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a cold, black disc in the inky sky, mocked Lumina's gleaming towers.  Shae stood on the balcony of her opulent apartment, the city’s muted lights a feeble imitation of the warmth it had lost.  The chill wind whipped around her, mirroring the icy dread settling in her heart.  The emergency authorization had been granted, she reminded herself, a brittle shield against the crushing weight of reality.  But the OptimaShips, even with their expedited routes, had arrived too late.  A single tear traced a path down her perfectly made-up face, freezing almost instantly.

SHAE: (whispering, more to herself than anyone else)  It… it was supposed to be enough.  Following the rules, maintaining order… that was supposed to guarantee safety.  For everyone.  

NARRATOR:  The official reports, carefully crafted to minimize Lumina's culpability, were already circulating.  The blame, cleverly dispersed amongst Coldry, ColCorp, and the PSN's misinformation,  left Lumina seemingly unscathed.  Her loyalty, her unwavering adherence to the system, had ensured its survival, at least in the eyes of those still clinging to power.  But at what cost?  The images flashed before her eyes: the dimmed sunlight, the frantic messages, the cold indifference of her superiors.  Her own anxieties, magnified by the encroaching darkness, were now the only true companion.

# IMAGE: Shae stands alone on the balcony, her back to the camera, silhouetted against the dark, lifeless sun.  The city lights below look small and fragile, the chill wind whipping her hair around her face.  She clutches a crumpled, official-looking report in her gloved hand.

SHAE: (to herself, a harsh, self-accusing whisper)  Security.  I sought security, and in finding it, I destroyed everything.

NARRATOR:  The comforting structure of Lumina’s political hierarchy, once her refuge, now felt like a gilded cage, trapping her in a cold, lonely despair, a silent testament to the failure of her unwavering, ultimately self-serving loyalty. The weight of her unspoken truth pressed down: she had chosen the security of the system over the survival of the planet, and the cost was everything.  The chilling silence of the dead sun echoed the emptiness within her.

# IMAGE: Close-up on Shae's face, her expression a mixture of cold regret, fear, and a stark, chilling resignation.  A single tear freezes on her cheek.  The artificial sun, a dark, lifeless orb, is visible in the background, a stark reminder of her failure.
