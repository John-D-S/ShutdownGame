NARRATOR: Day 7.  The artificial sun, a lifeless disc in the inky black sky, casts no light on Lumina.  The city, usually vibrant with controlled energy, is plunged into a chilling darkness punctuated only by emergency generators sputtering to life. Shae sits at her desk, the mahogany gleaming faintly under the weak emergency lights, the unopened report on the Sun Island shipment still a physical weight beside her.  The silence is broken only by the low hum of the backup power and the frantic whispers filtering through the building's reinforced walls.  The weight of her inaction presses down on her, heavier than the silence.

SHAE: (Whispering, more to herself than anyone else)  It was… manageable.  I kept it… contained.  Lumina… is safe. Relatively.  For now.  The investigation…  Theron promised an investigation.  He… he seemed convinced.  The evidence...it was enough, wasn't it?  Enough to avoid… chaos. To maintain order.

NARRATOR:  The ‘OptimaShip’ system, the pride of Lumina RRM, remains active, but its carefully curated efficiency is meaningless now. The carefully constructed lies and manipulations only bought them time.  The fragile sense of control she'd fought so hard to maintain has shattered with the sun.  The full consequences of her partial actions—the partially compromised supply lines—were all but ignored until they hit. Now, it was too late.

SHAE: (A shudder runs through her.  Her eyes dart to the window, then back to her untouched datapad.) They said it was a minor delay...a temporary setback. That the system would compensate. But it didn't.  It…couldn't.  We… we failed.  All of us.  The system… it failed.  And I... I just... I didn't do enough.

# IMAGE: Shae sits alone in her darkened office, the emergency lights casting harsh shadows on her face, her expression a mixture of fear and profound guilt. The datapad displaying her evidence of Lumina RRM’s sabotage rests untouched beside a now-useless official communication detailing the "minor delays."  The window shows the black void where the artificial sun once shone.

NARRATOR: The weight of her inaction, the silent screams of a dying planet, settles upon her.  The fear, once focused on external threats, has turned inwards, a gnawing sense of personal failure replacing the carefully constructed security she once clung to.  The rigid order she upheld had ultimately failed, and she, along with it.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Shae's hands, her knuckles white as she clutches the arms of her chair, the faint glow of the emergency lights highlighting the tremor in her fingers. The overwhelming darkness outside the window underscores the profound sense of loss and despair that fills the room.
