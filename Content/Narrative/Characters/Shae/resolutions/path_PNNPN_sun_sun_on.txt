NARRATOR:  The artificial sun, a sickly yellow disc in the hazy sky, hangs precariously above Lumina. Seven days. Seven days of dwindling hope, of carefully managed anxieties, of unwavering loyalty to a system that had betrayed her. Shae sits at her desk, the same polished mahogany desk, but the familiar weight of paperwork feels heavier, the lukewarm tea tastes like ash.  The news reports drone on about the sun's improbable survival, a miracle achieved by the combined efforts of others – others she had subtly undermined.

SHAE: (whispering, more to herself than anyone else)  A fortunate confluence... they say.  A miracle.  But it was *their* miracle. Not ours. Lumina’s careful hand, its measured approach, nearly cost us everything.  And yet… the system holds. I still hold my position.  (A shudder runs through her.)  But at what cost?

NARRATOR: The official report detailing Lumina RRM's culpability sits on her desk, unread.  She hasn’t even glanced at it.  The truth is a dangerous thing, far more disruptive than any carefully planned rebellion. The relief she feels at the sun's survival is tainted by a chilling sense of self-preservation, a deep-seated fear of the instability that would have arisen had Lumina been truly exposed.  Her actions, or rather, her inaction, her blind faith in the system—it almost cost them all. And her part in it will be quietly, officially forgotten.

# IMAGE: Shae stares out the window at the artificial sun, its light casting long, distorted shadows across her office.  Her face is etched with a mixture of relief, guilt, and a chilling quiet acceptance.  The official report, unread, lies discarded on her desk.

SHAE: (to herself, a hollow sigh escaping her lips)  Stability.  Security.  It’s all I ever wanted. And I have it.  Even if it’s built on a foundation of lies.

NARRATOR: The weight of her complicity settles upon her, a cold, heavy cloak. The system had survived, but at the cost of her integrity, and the near-destruction of their world.  She clings to her position within Lumina, a testament to the iron grip of her core urge, a chilling victory born of fear, not conviction.

# IMAGE: Close-up on Shae's hands, clasped tightly together, her knuckles white.  The faint, flickering light of the artificial sun illuminates the faint tremor in her hands. The image is framed by the shadows of the file cabinet containing the damning report, forever unread.
