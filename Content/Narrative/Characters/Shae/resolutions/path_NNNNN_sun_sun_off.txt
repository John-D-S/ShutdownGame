NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dark disc in the inky sky, mocked Shae from her window.  Seven days. Seven days of escalating warnings, of subtle manipulations, of carefully chosen inaction.  Seven days she’d clung to the familiar, comforting weight of Lumina’s established order, even as it crumbled around her.  The chill wind, sharper than ever before, whipped through the deserted streets of Lumina. The city, once a beacon of order and stability, was now plunged into a chaotic darkness.

SHAE: (Whispering, her voice trembling) It… it wasn't supposed to happen this way.  I did everything I was supposed to do. I followed protocol. I ensured loyalty... I maintained stability…

NARRATOR:  The words were hollow, a pathetic mantra against the stark reality of the extinguished sun.  The reports detailing the complete failure of the exotope supply lines, the sabotage by Lumina RRM, lay on her desk, a damning testament to her failure.  She hadn't uncovered the full extent of the corruption, hadn't dared to disrupt the system she relied upon, even when faced with the impending doom of her world. Fear, that familiar companion, had paralyzed her.  Loyalty, the cornerstone of her existence, had become her downfall.

# IMAGE: Shae sits alone in her darkened office, the only light source emanating from a flickering emergency lamp.  The reports of Lumina RRM's sabotage are scattered around her, stark against the oppressive darkness.  Her face is a mask of despair, her eyes devoid of the usual anxious vigilance.

SHAE: (To herself, a choked sob escaping her lips)  They said it was for the best… for everyone… for Lumina’s security.  But what good is security in the dark? What good is order when there’s nothing left to order?

NARRATOR: The weight of her failure, the crushing weight of the cold, dying world, settled upon her.  The security she craved, the order she’d strived for, was gone, replaced by a terrifying, absolute emptiness.  Her actions, or rather, her inactions, had condemned Ita to a bleak and unforgiving future.  The lie she’d lived by, the belief in the inherent goodness of the established order, had proven to be a fatal delusion.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of the city of Lumina, shrouded in darkness, the extinguished artificial sun a black void in the sky.  A lone figure, Shae, stands silhouetted against a window, her form small and insignificant against the vast, desolate landscape.
