NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dull, lifeless orb in the inky sky, cast long, cold shadows across Lumina.  Seven days. Seven days since the first warnings, seven days of carefully managed anxiety, seven days of half-measures and whispered anxieties.  Shae stood on the balcony of her apartment, the city lights a feeble imitation of the warmth they once provided.  The chill wasn't just in the air; it was deep in her bones.

SHAE: (Whispering, more to herself than anyone else)  They said it was a minor logistical issue… a technical glitch…  But the darkness… it's absolute.

NARRATOR:  The partial sabotage of Lumina RRM's supply lines, discovered but not fully exposed, had played its part.  The system, the very structure she'd dedicated her life to upholding, had ultimately failed, leaving her exposed to the consequences. The whispers of dissent that she'd so carefully managed to suppress now roared in the emptiness, a chorus of fear and regret.

# IMAGE: Shae silhouetted against the dark sky, the lifeless artificial sun a pale disc behind her. Her shoulders are slumped, her face etched with a mixture of fear and exhaustion.  The city lights twinkle faintly in the distance, a stark contrast to the overwhelming darkness.

SHAE: (Her voice cracks)  It was supposed to be predictable… controlled… safe.  I followed the rules, I maintained order… and yet…

NARRATOR:  The official narrative—a mixture of technical malfunctions and unforeseen circumstances—still echoed through Lumina’s propaganda channels.  But the city’s panicked silence spoke a far different truth.  Shae clung to the familiar weight of her datapad, a useless symbol of a failed system, a failed strategy, and ultimately, a failed life built on a lie. She had chosen security, loyalty to a broken system; now, that system had offered her nothing but cold, harsh darkness.

# IMAGE: Shae's datapad lies discarded on the cold balcony floor, the screen cracked, a mirror reflecting the broken promise of the artificial sun and the fractured reality that was once Lumina.  

NARRATOR:  The core urge, the deep-seated need for security and guidance, had led her to a point where the very definition of security had been erased. The only certainty was the freezing darkness.  The artificial sun was off, and so, in a way, was she.
