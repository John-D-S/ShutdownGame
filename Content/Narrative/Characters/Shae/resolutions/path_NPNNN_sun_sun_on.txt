NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a weak, flickering orb in the sky, casts long, skeletal shadows across Lumina. Seven days. Seven days since the crisis began, seven days of escalating anxiety, and seven days Shae had clung to the familiar, suffocating embrace of the system, even as it crumbled around her.  The sun, improbably, still shines, a testament to the frantic efforts of others, efforts she did little to aid.  

SHAE: (Whispering, to herself, staring at a datapad displaying fluctuating energy readings)  They said it was a minor logistical issue… Coldry’s fault…  It was all… manageable.  Minister Theron said so.  The Minister of Transportation said so.  The PSN… they assured us…

NARRATOR:  The official reports, meticulously crafted to minimize Lumina's culpability, are spread across her desk, a testament to her unwavering adherence to the established order. The truth, a bitter taste in her mouth, sits heavy and unspoken. She had prioritized the system’s image above the planet’s survival. The delays, the deliberate obfuscation, the prioritization of internal politics over planetary needs – all were elements she helped facilitate or at least passively enabled.  The sun’s survival was a fluke, a stroke of luck that made her complicity all the more appalling.

# IMAGE: Shae sits alone in her opulent but now dimly lit office, surrounded by official documents that, under the weak sunlight, seem like flimsy shields against the truth. Her posture is stiff, her face etched with a mixture of exhaustion, fear, and a dawning awareness of her complicity.

SHAE: (A low, choked sob escapes her)  They’re all… they’re all still alive.  The sun… it’s still…  But what have *I* done?  What have I become?

NARRATOR: The weight of her inaction presses down on her, heavier than any political pressure.  The fragile peace, the precarious balance, hangs by a thread, purchased with the unspoken compromises she made. The system she so fervently defended had almost betrayed her, and her fear of jeopardizing her standing had ensured that it almost destroyed everything.  The sun is on, yes, but it casts no warmth on her soul.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Shae's hands, tightly clenched around a chipped teacup, the weak sunlight highlighting the trembling in her fingers.  The reflection of the flickering sun in her eyes shows a flicker of something akin to understanding. but more so, profound disillusionment.
