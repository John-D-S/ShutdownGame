NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dull, lifeless disc in the darkening sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the deserted plaza.  Seven days. Seven days of frantic efforts, of carefully calculated moves, of compromises that gnawed at her conscience.  Shae stood alone, the chill wind whipping her tailored jacket around her. The city of Lumina, usually bustling with activity, was eerily silent, a hush settling over the populace as the reality of their situation sank in.  Her carefully maintained composure, the shield she’d built around her anxieties, cracked. The victory felt hollow.

SHAE: (Whispering, her voice barely audible above the wind)  The supplies… they got through.  Most of them. Enough to… to buy some time, perhaps. But it wasn't enough.  Not really.  (She looks up at the dead sun, a flicker of something akin to defiance briefly illuminating her face before it's replaced with exhaustion)  I followed the rules. I did everything they asked. I upheld the system.  And it… it still failed us.

NARRATOR: The news reports – a cacophony of blame, fear, and desperate pleas – played on a nearby, cracked screen, showing images of the inert sun and panicked citizens.  The whispers of the saboteurs within Lumina RRM still echoed in her ears, a chilling reminder of the fragility of the system she'd sworn to protect.  The weight of her actions, her compromises, the weight of the system’s ultimate failure, pressed down on her. Despite her success in bypassing the sabotage, the damage from ColCorp's substandard canisters and the PSN’s misinformation proved insurmountable. 

SHAE: (To herself, a bitter laugh escaping her lips)  Security.  Stability.  Prosperity.  All lies.  Empty promises whispered by a dying star.  (She clenches her fists, a fierce determination hardening her features) But… I fought. I did *something*. Even if it wasn’t enough.  Even if it only delayed the inevitable.  Maybe that’s all any of us can do sometimes.

# IMAGE: Shae stands silhouetted against the lifeless sun, a single tear tracing a path down her cheek.  The city of Lumina is shrouded in a twilight gloom, a stark contrast to its usual vibrant energy.  A distant, faint siren wails in the distance.

# IMAGE: Close-up of Shae's hand, clutching a small, worn photograph of her family – a testament to the system she fought for and the security she thought it provided, now shattered alongside Ita's artificial sun.  Her knuckles are white, her grip tight. The image is slightly blurred, reflecting the uncertainty and emotional turmoil of her situation.
