NARRATOR:  Seven days. Seven days of flickering sunlight, of whispers and anxieties, of betrayals and quiet acts of defiance.  Shae stood on the balcony of her Lumina apartment, the artificial sun a pale, uneven disc in the sky.  It shone, a fragile victory hard-won. Below, the city hummed with a nervous energy, the relief palpable but fragile.

SHAE: (Whispering, more to herself than anyone else)  It’s…on.  They say it’s on.  But for how long?  The reports…the numbers…they’re still precarious.

NARRATOR: The news reports spoke of a delicate balance, a precarious victory bought with compromises and clandestine actions. Crystal's desperate fight in Southpoint, Dax's exposé of the PSN's lies, Trent’s struggle in Coldry – all woven together with her own dangerous maneuver.  She had chosen to act, a terrifying departure from her ingrained belief in the system's protective embrace.

# IMAGE: Shae gazes out at the city of Lumina, the artificial sun casting long, uneven shadows across its buildings. Her expression is one of weary relief, tinged with underlying anxiety.  A single, wilted flower lies on the balcony railing beside her.

SHAE: (To herself, a trace of bitterness in her voice)  They’ll never know.  Not the full truth.  The forged documents, the risks…it's a secret I must carry.  But at least...at least the sun is shining. For now.

NARRATOR: The victory felt hollow, a thin layer of security over a chasm of systemic corruption.  The fragile peace was bought at a price, a price Shae, the dutiful politician, was now prepared to pay – the constant, gnawing fear of exposure, a fear that would always linger, a stark reminder of the precarious balance she had so painstakingly – and dangerously – maintained. The system remained flawed, yet she had inadvertently become part of its unsteady salvation.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Shae's hand, clutching a small, worn coin – a symbol of Lumina – her knuckles white, her nails bitten short.  A single tear tracks a path through the grime on her cheek.  The artificial sun's light catches the glint of the coin, momentarily bright against the continuing uncertainty of the city below.
