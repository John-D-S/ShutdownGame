NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a cold, black eye in the deepening twilight, hangs lifeless in the Ita sky.  Lumina, usually a beacon of controlled order, is plunged into chaos.  Shae, her meticulously styled hair askew, sits alone in the wreckage of her once pristine office.  The faint scent of burnt exotope hangs heavy in the air – a grim reminder of the emergency reserves Lumina selfishly hoarded.

SHAE: (Whispering, her voice tight with fear and regret)  It… it wasn’t supposed to end like this.  I… I followed the rules.  I upheld the system.  I did everything they told me to do.

NARRATOR: The weight of her actions, the lies she told, the opportunities she missed, crush her. The “stability” she so desperately craved is gone, replaced by a terrifying, uncontrolled darkness.  She had prioritized Lumina's position, ensuring it would survive the fallout… even at the cost of the planet. The automaton’s stern warnings were not lies, they were desperate pleas ignored through the lens of her own survival instinct.

# IMAGE: Shae sits hunched over, her face illuminated by the flickering emergency lights, surrounded by the scattered debris of her destroyed office.  The black void of the dead sun is visible through the shattered window, casting long, distorted shadows.

SHAE: (To herself, a choked sob escaping)  Minister Theron… the High Council… they… they promised… they promised protection.  They promised… safety.

NARRATOR:  The irony isn't lost on her – the system she so fiercely protected, the authority she blindly followed, ultimately failed her, and everyone else. Her fear hasn't been erased, but it's now tainted by the bitter realization that her loyalty was misplaced; the system wasn't a shield, but a gilded cage from which she, along with everyone else, fell to their doom.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Shae’s face, etched with the exhaustion of fear and the dawning horror of her understanding: the system she defended wasn't just flawed; it was actively malicious, and she had been a willing participant in its demise.  The light from a distant, dying emergency lamp reflects in her tear-filled eyes.
