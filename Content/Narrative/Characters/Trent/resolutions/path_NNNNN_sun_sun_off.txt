NARRATOR: Day seven. The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black sky, mirrored the hollowness in Trent's gut.  The rhythmic clang of the Coldry factory was gone, replaced by a chilling silence broken only by the wind whistling through shattered windows.  Dust motes danced in the weak beam of his headlamp, illuminating the wreckage of his defiance.  The factory, once his domain, was a testament to his failure.

TRENT: (Spitting on the ground, the sound surprisingly soft)  Damn ColCorp. Damn the lot of ‘em.  They wanted more, faster.  Said the automatons were gonna crack down anyway…so what’s the difference?  I showed ‘em. I showed those soft bastards.

NARRATOR: But showing them hadn't saved anything.  His aggressive tactics hadn't forced ColCorp's hand; they had simply broken the system. The flood of faulty canisters, his own twisted attempt at control, had choked the life out of the sun. The union, fractured and demoralized, offered no solace.  His own desperate attempt at strength, his refusal to trust anyone, had brought about this desolate end.

# IMAGE: Trent sits amidst the debris of the Coldry factory, his back against a collapsed wall, a single flickering headlamp casting harsh shadows on his grim, defeated face.  The sky is a vast, star-studded black, the artificial sun a distant, cold memory.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, his voice barely audible)  Strength…control…it wasn't enough.  Never was. Just kept pushing harder…  Shoulda…shoulda trusted someone.  But they’ll all pay. They'll ALL pay for this.  

NARRATOR: The cold wind whipped around him, carrying with it the ashes of his failed rebellion. The harsh reality settled: his stubborn strength had not protected anyone, least of all himself.  He was alone, the cold void mirroring the emptiness inside him.  He had won a battle, but lost the war, a war he had fought alone, blinded by his own self-made darkness.  

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's hands, calloused and scarred, clutching a broken wrench – a symbol of his shattered strength and control.  The background is the desolate, dark factory, a bleak representation of his profound failure and the world plunged into darkness.
