NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a molten eye in the bruised twilight sky, hung stubbornly on.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of barely holding back the tide. Trent stood on the Coldry factory roof, the wind whipping at his worn jacket. Below, the factory hummed, a testament to his – and Coldry's – stubborn refusal to break.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Held on, did we?  Damn near broke us, though.

NARRATOR: The news had trickled in – bits and pieces gleaned from crackling radio broadcasts.  About the successes of others.  Crystal, Shae, Dax…their victories barely registering in the dull ache in his shoulders and the grit in his teeth.  He'd pushed ColCorp back, forced some concessions, but the system…the damned system remained.  Cracked, maybe, but not broken.  The compromised canisters, a constant gnawing anxiety in the back of his mind.

TRENT: (Spits on the ground)  Partial win.  Ain't enough.

NARRATOR: He looked at the sun, a distant, indifferent eye in the sky. The relief was cold, thin.  It wasn't the triumph he'd craved, the absolute control, the crushing victory over the forces that threatened Coldry.  It was…a stalemate.  A weary, hard-won holding action.  And in that hard-won holding action, a flicker of something else began to ignite.  Not quite acceptance, but…a grudging respect for the stubborn resilience it took, not just from him, but from everyone who'd fought this fight.

# IMAGE: Trent silhouetted against the artificial sun, his posture less rigid, less tense.  The wind ruffles his hair, but his gaze is fixed, not on the sun, but on the sprawling city of Coldry below, a quiet determination in his eyes.

TRENT:  Next time…next time they won't get away with it.

# IMAGE: Close up on Trent's hands, still calloused and strong, but now holding a worn, but well-loved photo of his family. A hint of something akin to softness in his eyes.


NARRATOR: The fight wasn't over.  It never would be, not for as long as ColCorp and the forces that propped them up existed. But for now, Coldry, and the sun, survived.  And Trent, bruised but unbroken, would be ready.  He would make sure of it.
