NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the darkening sky, mirrored the hollowness in Trent's chest.  Dust motes danced in the weak, failing light filtering through the grimy window of his Coldry apartment. The city was silent, a heavy blanket of despair draped over its usually defiant spirit.  The rhythmic clang of the factory, once a comforting drone, was absent, replaced by a chilling quiet.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, staring at a half-empty bottle of cheap liquor)  Shoulda… shoulda…  They shoulda listened.  Damn ColCorp. Damn the whole rotten system.  All that fight… for nothing.

NARRATOR:  The failure wasn't just ColCorp’s; it was his own. His brutal tactics hadn't forced change; they'd broken things further. The flood of faulty canisters, a direct result of his violent confrontation and the subsequent factory shutdown, had choked the sun's lifeblood.  His fiercely protective nature, his unwavering belief in strength as the only solution, had blinded him to the systemic rot eating away at Ita. The union, once his bulwark, was fractured and demoralized.  His attempts at control had only resulted in a devastating loss of control.

# IMAGE: Trent sits slumped in a chair, the artificial sun a dim, lifeless orb in the window, casting long, melancholy shadows.  Empty exotope canisters litter the floor, a grim testament to his failure.  His fists are clenched, knuckles white, his face etched with a mixture of exhaustion, anger, and a flicker of something akin to regret.

TRENT: (A low growl escaping his lips)  Weak… they’re all weak. Couldn’t see the truth.  But I… I was strong. I *tried*.

NARRATOR: The lie he’d told himself—that strength alone ensured safety—crumbled under the weight of the planet's dying light.  His usual intense, forceful demeanor was replaced by a weary resignation. The only strength left felt like the bitter sting of defeat.  The flickering candlelight barely illuminated the grim reality: his defiance hadn't saved Coldry; it had condemned it.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Trent's hands, calloused and scarred, holding a single, perfectly crafted exotope canister – a forgotten relic from the hidden reserve he’d discovered early on, a silent reminder of a missed opportunity, a path not taken. The canister is undamaged, almost pristine, yet useless against the now-extinguished sun.

TRENT: (Whispering)  Maybe… maybe vulnerability wasn't weakness after all.
