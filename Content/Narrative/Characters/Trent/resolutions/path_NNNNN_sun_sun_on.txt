NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised sky, still burned.  A precarious victory, they called it. Trent spat on the cracked concrete of the Coldry factory yard, the taste of ash and regret bitter on his tongue.  The rhythmic clang of machinery, usually a comfort, was a mocking reminder of his failure.

TRENT: (Muttering)  Precarious.  That's what they call it.  Like a goddamn tightrope walk over a pit of fire.  And I pushed us closer to the edge.

NARRATOR: The canister production line, crippled by his actions, still sputtered.  His attempts to control ColCorp, to force them into compliance, had backfired spectacularly. The union was fractured, mistrust festering amongst the ranks. His supposed protection of his workers had resulted in less canisters, potentially causing a much larger crisis than a lack of canisters alone.

# IMAGE: Trent stands alone amidst the wreckage of the Coldry factory, his shoulders slumped, the weak sunlight illuminating the dust motes swirling around him.  Damaged exotope canisters litter the ground, a grim testament to his efforts.

TRENT:  (To himself, a low growl) They're all weak.  Reliant on the system, begging for handouts.  Thought I could force them to be strong.  Thought I could control everything.  Foolish.

NARRATOR: The sun's continued operation wasn't a testament to his strength, but a testament to the haphazard efforts of others.  Their success was a bitter pill, proving his methods were not only flawed but dangerously ineffective against the systemic decay of Ita.  The weight of his failure pressed down on him, heavier than any physical exertion.  His control, his carefully constructed fortress of strength, had crumbled, revealing not the chaos he feared, but the quiet, gnawing truth of his own inadequacy.

# IMAGE:  A long shot of the artificial sun, a pale and sickly yellow disc in the sky, casting long, harsh shadows across the devastated Coldry landscape.  Trent is a tiny figure in the foreground, dwarfed by the vastness of his failure.

TRENT: (A sigh, barely audible) Maybe…maybe vulnerability ain't weakness after all.  But that don't change a damn thing.  The fight ain't over.  Just…different.
