NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black sky, mirrored the hollowness in Trent's chest.  Coldry was plunged into an unnatural twilight, the air thick with a chilling silence that was far more terrifying than the factory's usual clang.  The failure of the sun wasn't a sudden crash; it was a slow, agonizing fade, a perfect reflection of his own increasingly futile struggle against ColCorp.

TRENT: (Spitting on the frozen ground)  They… they knew.  They *knew* the canisters were shit, and they let it happen.  Every goddamn one of those faulty things, my own damn hand helped build… or cripple.  

# IMAGE: Trent stands alone amidst the snow-covered ruins of the Coldry factory, the lifeless artificial sun a bleak backdrop. His face is etched with exhaustion and bitter defeat, his usually imposing figure slumped with despair.  Broken machinery and discarded exotope canisters litter the ground around him.

NARRATOR: His defiance, his relentless fight for control, had only accelerated the catastrophe. The union, paralyzed by fear, had offered no real help.  His aggressive tactics hadn't broken ColCorp; they'd only solidified their power.  His anger, once a shield, now felt like a useless weight dragging him down. The stated belief that strength and order alone ensured safety had crumbled, replaced by the bitter truth of his helplessness. The systemic nature of the problem overwhelmed his urge to personally control the outcome.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, his voice barely audible)  Shoulda… shoulda just…  (He trails off, the unspoken words lost in the desolate silence.)  Strength ain’t enough.  Didn’t matter how strong I was...

# IMAGE: A close-up shot of Trent's calloused hands, now covered in frostbite, clenching and unclenching. His knuckles are white, mirroring the cold, harsh reality of his failure.

NARRATOR:  The cold seeped into his bones, matching the chill of despair that settled deep within him.  The artificial sun was out, and so was the fight in Trent. His journey on Ita ended not in a blaze of glory or controlled defiance, but in a bitter, quiet surrender to the darkness that had consumed his world. The only remaining power was the bleak acceptance of his defeat.
