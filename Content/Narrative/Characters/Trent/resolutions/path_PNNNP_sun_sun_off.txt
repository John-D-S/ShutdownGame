NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale ghost in the inky sky, offered no warmth.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the factory window, illuminating the grim set of Trent's jaw.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of barely holding back the tide.  And it wasn't enough.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, staring at a pile of rejected canisters)  Damn ColCorp.  Damn their cheap shit.  I… I *fought*.  I made them use better materials. For a while, anyway.  But…

NARRATOR:  The news had spread like wildfire – the sun was dead.  The whispers of systemic failure, of Lumina's sabotage, of Helios's greed, of the PSN’s lies – they all coalesced into a bitter truth: his hard-won victories were too little, too late.  The small gains in Coldry's production had been swallowed by the larger, systemic failures.

# IMAGE: Trent stands alone in the Coldry factory, the setting sun casting long, mournful shadows. His hands are calloused and scarred, and he clutches a dented exotope canister, a symbol of his hard-won, ultimately futile efforts. The factory's silent machinery hums a disquieting dirge.

TRENT: (A low growl escapes his lips)  They said… they said it was about strength, about control. About fighting to keep the weak from suffering.  But what about now?  What about when even the strongest blows can't change what's already broken?

NARRATOR: He felt the familiar rage simmering, but it was a different kind of anger this time – not the explosive fury directed at individual oppressors, but a cold, hard resentment at the very nature of the system, a system that allowed a single point of failure to doom them all.  His stated belief, the lie he told himself to survive, felt hollow in the face of this absolute, unyielding darkness.  The strength he’d clung to felt meaningless.  The control he’d desperately sought, lost.  The protection he’d promised, broken.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the dying light, looks out at the darkening landscape of Coldry.  A sense of profound weariness, almost resignation, settles upon him, a rare display of vulnerability that clashes with his usual steely resolve. The city's lights, meager and distant, offer little hope.

TRENT: (His voice barely a whisper)  Maybe… maybe vulnerability ain’t weakness after all.  Maybe fighting this… this ain’t a fight I can win alone.

NARRATOR: The realization hung heavy, a bitter pill swallowed with the dust of a dying world. The fight wasn’t over; it had just changed.
