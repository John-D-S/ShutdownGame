NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black sky, mirrored the emptiness in Trent's gut.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of forcing a system rigged against him to bend to his will.  Seven days that changed nothing.  Coldry's factory stood silent, a monument to his partial victory, a hollow testament to his defiant efforts.

TRENT: (His voice, usually a booming challenge, was a low growl.)  They promised better materials.  Bullshit.  A few less shoddy canisters, maybe.  But enough to matter?  Not a damn bit.  

# IMAGE: Trent stands alone on a Coldry rooftop, the dead sun a stark backdrop. His hands, calloused and scarred from years of factory work, are clenched into fists. His expression is a blend of weary resignation and simmering rage.

NARRATOR: The news had trickled down â€“ a catastrophic failure, a chain of systemic issues that even his raw strength couldn't overcome. The automatons, silent for hours, had finally started their shutdown protocol. He knew what that meant.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, the words laced with self-disgust and a flicker of the vulnerability he fought so hard to suppress.)  Control. I needed control.  Thought it was the only way.  But it wasn't enough.  Never enough.  

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's face, his eyes reflecting the cold light of the dying sun. A single tear traces a path through the grime on his cheek, a stark contrast to his usually fierce expression.  

NARRATOR:  The icy wind whipped around him, a chilling reminder of the coming darkness. The cold wasn't just outside; it gnawed at him from within. He hadn't saved Coldry.  He hadn't broken the system. He'd only scratched the surface.  And the surface, it seemed, was all that would remain.  The fight for survival, he knew, was far from over.
