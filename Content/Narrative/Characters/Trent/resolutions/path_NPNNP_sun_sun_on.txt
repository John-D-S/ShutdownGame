NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a weak but persistent ember in the sky, casts a pale light across the Coldry factory. Trent, his face etched with weariness but not defeat, leans against a crate, watching the workers slowly filter out.  The air still hums with the aftershock of the near-catastrophe, a tension that clings like dust to everything.  ColCorp backed down, yes, but only after a near-miss.  Their concessions were meager, a temporary bandage on a festering wound.  He knows the compromised canisters, a few slipped through the cracks, still made their way to Sun Island.  

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, running a hand through his grimy hair)  A damn victory…for now.  They didn't break us, not this time. But neither did we win. Not really.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight filtering through a grimy factory window, his shoulders slumped but his jaw tight.  A discarded, slightly damaged exotope canister lies at his feet, a silent testament to his partial success.  The faces of his fellow union members, visible in the background, are a mix of relief and underlying worry.

NARRATOR: The news from Confluence trickles in –  a fragile alliance, a last-minute scramble.  Crystal, Shae, Dax... their names echo faintly through the gossip, whispers of heroism and desperation.  The sun’s survival wasn't entirely due to their efforts in Coldry.  Trent feels a grudging respect, a flicker of something akin to admiration, but it’s buried deep under layers of his hardened exterior.  The system’s flaws remain, vast and unforgiving, a constant threat looming larger than any one factory foreman. His control, his fiercely protective stance, bought them time, but it didn't solve the systemic problems gnawing at Ita’s heart.

TRENT: (A low growl, more to himself than anyone else) Time…that’s all we bought.  Time for more fighting.  Time to find another way…to find more leverage.

# IMAGE: A close-up shot of Trent’s calloused hand tightening around a worn wrench, the setting sun casting a long shadow across his determined face. The image emphasizes his enduring resilience, but also hints at the ongoing struggle ahead. The sun is visible in the background, weak but still burning.
