NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dying ember in the inky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the deserted Coldry factory floor. Dust motes danced in the weak light, illuminating the wreckage of Trent's efforts.  Broken machinery lay scattered, a testament to his battles with ColCorp.  The air hung heavy with the smell of burnt metal and despair.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of trying to control the uncontrollable.  And it was all for nothing.

TRENT: (Spitting on the ground, the sound sharp and brittle in the silence)  Damn ColCorp.  Damn Lumina. Damn the whole rotten system.  I fought, I bled, I *broke* things… and the sun still went out.

NARRATOR:  He ran a calloused hand over his jaw, the lingering ache a reminder of his recent clashes with ColCorp security.  His stated belief – that strength and control were the only things that kept Coldry safe – felt like ash in his mouth.  The partially successful improvements he'd wrung from the factory were insignificant in the face of the catastrophe.  Compromised canisters, his own flawed contribution, were a part of what caused this.

# IMAGE: Trent stands alone amidst the wreckage of the Coldry factory, the dying light of Ita's artificial sun painting his face in shades of grey and despair.  His posture is slumped, but his gaze remains defiant, fixed on the darkening sky.  A single, broken exotope canister lies near his feet.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  They said it was a confluence of failures…  But it feels like *my* failure.  Like all this…  all this fighting… was for nothing.

NARRATOR: The silence pressed in on him, the weight of the world's ending settling heavily on his shoulders.  His usual intensity was replaced with a bone-deep weariness.  The cold, hard truth was finally sinking in: his compulsion to control hadn't saved anyone. His fierce loyalty and protectiveness hadn't been enough.  It had all been too little, too late. The fight was over, and he was left with only the bitter taste of defeat and the chilling reality of Ita's dying light.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of the Coldry factory complex at twilight, the artificial sun a faint, dying glow on the horizon.  The factory appears small and vulnerable against the vastness of the darkening sky, mirroring Trent's own feelings of helplessness.
