NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black, mirrored the hollowness in Trent's gut.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of forcing control over a system designed to break him. He stood on the roof of the Coldry factory, the wind whipping at his worn jacket, the city below shrouded in an unnatural twilight.  The rhythmic clang of the factory, once a comforting drone, was silent now.  A bitter victory.

TRENT: (spitting on the ground)  Better canisters.  They called it a 'good outcome'.  Like some damn corporate report.  Like it matters now.  The sun's out, ain't it?  Coldry's still standing.  But what good is that?  

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the dark sky, his shoulders slumped but his posture still defiant. The city below is dark and still, punctuated by the faint, distant glow of emergency lights.  The artificial sun is a completely black void.


NARRATOR:  He’d fought ColCorp, teeth and nails, and won a small battle.  He’d secured the integrity of the canisters.  But Shae's lines were cut, Crystal's exposé too little, Dax’s warnings too late. The systemic rot, the political games, the corporate greed... they’d all conspired to bring Ita to its knees. His individual triumph felt like a grain of sand against the weight of a collapsing world. The union, silent and fearful, hadn't moved beyond their immediate concerns. His loyalty, his strength, had been used to patch a hole in a sinking ship.

TRENT: (muttering to himself)  Strength…control…  It wasn't enough.  Never enough. Not when the whole damn system's rigged.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's hands – calloused, strong, but trembling slightly.  The faint glimmer of starlight reflects in his eyes, holding a mixture of anger and profound weariness.

NARRATOR: The cold settled deep into his bones, a colder kind of darkness than the one swallowing Ita.  He had protected his own, but even that felt like a pyrrhic victory under the suffocating blanket of night.  The fight was far from over, and for the first time, Trent felt a chilling uncertainty – a vulnerability he had always fought so hard to suppress, now laid bare under the cold gaze of the dead sun.
