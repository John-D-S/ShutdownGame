NARRATOR: The seventh day dawned, the artificial sun a weak, sickly yellow in the Coldry sky.  The air hung heavy with the scent of exhaust and a pervasive sense of exhaustion. Trent stood on the factory roof, the rhythmic clang of machinery a distant, muffled echo. His knuckles were raw, his clothes torn. The walkout hadn't happened. The canister crisis—his crisis—had only worsened.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, staring at the distant, flickering sun)  Damn…they…they’re still running.  Still churning out those…those *things*.  

NARRATOR: The consequences of his actions—or rather, his lack of strategic thinking—were stark.  His aggressive tactics hadn't forced ColCorp's hand; they’d only solidified their control. His attempt to maintain control had resulted in a complete loss of it.  The faulty canisters continued to flow, compromising the exotope supply to the sun. The sun, despite everyone's desperate efforts, clung to life by a thread.  He hadn’t protected anyone; he'd only made things worse.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, his back to the camera, shoulders slumped.  The Coldry factory stretches behind him, a symbol of his failure.  The artificial sun is a weak, pale disc in the sky, a testament to the precariousness of their situation.


TRENT: (A low growl escapes his lips)  Strength…control…it wasn’t enough.  It never is.

NARRATOR:  The news had trickled in—bits and pieces gleaned from hushed conversations, desperate whispers. Shae, Dax, Crystal…they'd done what they could.  The sun was still burning, but the victory felt hollow, pyrrhic. The system, the very structures he’d relied on for strength and order, had proven brittle, their cracks only exposed by his own violent attempts to control them. He’d lost, and in doing so, he'd realized the weakness of his belief. The strength he’d sought wasn't in brute force or control, but in something…else. Something he still couldn't name.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Trent's hand, calloused and scarred, gripping a loose stone from the factory roof. His gaze is distant, his expression a mixture of anger and something akin to…regret.


TRENT: (His voice barely a whisper) They almost…they almost didn't make it. And it’s *my* fault.
