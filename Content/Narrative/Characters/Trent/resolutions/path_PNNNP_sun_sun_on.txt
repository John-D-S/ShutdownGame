NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a weak but persistent disc in the sky, cast a pale light over Coldry.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of barely holding back the tide of ColCorp’s greed and the looming threat of the sun’s death. Trent stood on the factory roof, the biting wind whipping at his worn jacket.  The rhythmic clang of the machinery below was a dull counterpoint to the pounding in his head.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Shoulda… shoulda been more.  Coulda…

NARRATOR: He looked at the freshly-painted "Coldry Workers' Union" banner flapping in the wind, a testament to his stubborn defiance.  His fists clenched, a familiar ache in his knuckles.  The partial victory – the improved canisters, the concessions wrung from ColCorp – felt hollow.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon. The Coldry factory sprawls below him, a testament to his relentless fight but also a symbol of the systemic issues he couldn't overcome. His face is etched with weariness and a hint of unacknowledged doubt.


TRENT: (Gripping the railing)  They still cut corners.  Still push too hard.  It wasn’t enough.  Damn it, it wasn’t enough.

NARRATOR:  He knew the sun was still burning, a fragile victory bought with the collective efforts of others.  He’d played his part, but the deep-seated rot within ColCorp, within the system, remained.  The anger, the controlled rage that had fueled him for a week, now felt… empty.  A weary resignation settled over him, a grim acceptance of the ongoing struggle.  The fight wasn't over.  It never really was.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's hands, calloused and scarred, gripping the cold metal railing. His knuckles are white, betraying the tension beneath his outward stoicism.  In the background, the artificial sun hangs faintly in the sky, a fragile symbol of survival.


TRENT: (A low, almost inaudible sigh)  Not enough… but it’s… holding. For now.
