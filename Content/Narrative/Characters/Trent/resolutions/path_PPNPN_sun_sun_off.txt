NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dying ember in the inky black, cast long, skeletal shadows across the Coldry factory.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy windows, a fitting metaphor for the failure of Trent's efforts.  Seven days. Seven days to save Ita, and he’d only managed to partially fix the problem.  He hadn't stopped ColCorp's sabotage completely, hadn't single-handedly saved the world. He'd just...delayed the inevitable.

TRENT: (grunting, shoving a wrench into his toolbox)  Damn ColCorp.  Damn Lumina. Damn everyone who thought they could screw us over and get away with it.  Shoulda crushed them all.

NARRATOR:  He slammed the toolbox shut, the metallic clang echoing the hollowness in his chest.  The partially successful canister improvements he’d managed were a drop in an ocean that was already running dry.  The systemic failures, the bureaucratic inertia, the sheer scale of the problem, it had all overwhelmed his attempts at brute-force control. His usual strength felt…useless.  A bitter taste settled on his tongue.  The union’s murmurs about a possible evacuation were a grim counterpoint to the rhythmic hum of the now-silent factory machinery.

# IMAGE: Trent stands amidst the darkened factory, his silhouette outlined against the dying light of the artificial sun. His shoulders slump, a rare display of defeat, but his jaw is still clenched, his gaze hard and unforgiving.  Empty exotope canisters are scattered around him, a testament to his incomplete victory.

TRENT: (muttering to himself) Order…strength…always strength.  That's what I believed.  Kept us safe…or so I thought.  This…this ain’t order. This is just…the end.  But it ain't over for me. Not yet.

NARRATOR: He looked out at the darkening sky, his eyes narrowed. Even in defeat, the defiant spark of Coldry burned within him.  This wasn’t the end.  This was a new beginning, a new fight, a new struggle for survival against forces far beyond ColCorp’s reach.  He just needed to figure out what that fight would look like.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's face, etched with grim determination, his eyes reflecting the dying light of the artificial sun. A single tear tracks down his weathered cheek, quickly wiped away. The defiance in his eyes is not extinguished but transformed – it is tempered by a newfound understanding of the limitations of brute force. He's still a fighter, just one who now understands that fighting smart might be even more important than fighting hard.
