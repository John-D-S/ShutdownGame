NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, black disc in the inky sky, mocked Trent's efforts.  The chill wind biting through Coldry felt colder than ever. He stood atop the factory, the repaired canisters – a testament to his brutal efficiency – stacked beneath him, useless.  His knuckles were white, gripping a wrench tighter than necessary.

TRENT: (A low growl, more to himself than anyone else)  We held our line.  We *made* them work.  So what the fuck happened?

NARRATOR: The silence of Coldry was heavier than the darkness.  His loyal crew, faces etched with exhaustion and disbelief, stood behind him, their silence a shared acknowledgment of failure. Trent’s victory felt like a punch to the gut. He’d bent ColCorp to his will, but the systemic rot had been too deep, too widespread.  Shae, Crystal, Dax...  their struggles, their failures, were suddenly visceral, as real as the cold seeping into his bones. His stated belief, that strength and control were the sole guarantors of safety, now felt like a cruel joke.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the lifeless artificial sun, his back to the camera, his shoulders slumped. Below him, a pile of meticulously repaired exotope canisters sits in the cold darkness, a symbol of his hard-won, ultimately futile struggle. The faces of his exhausted crew are barely visible in the shadows.


TRENT: (His voice cracking slightly, a vulnerability he fiercely fought to suppress)  It wasn't enough…  It was never enough.

NARRATOR:  The weight of the world, and the crushing realization of his own limitations, settled onto him.  The fight for Coldry was far from over, but for the first time, Trent felt the cold sting of fear, a fear not of external forces, but of the vastness of a problem he couldn't personally control.  The resilience remained, the strength, but tempered now with a flicker of understanding, a seed of something beyond brute force.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's calloused hand, still gripping the wrench, but now trembling slightly.  A single tear streaks a path through the grime on his cheek, a silent admission of his failure and the terrifying reality of Ita's future.
