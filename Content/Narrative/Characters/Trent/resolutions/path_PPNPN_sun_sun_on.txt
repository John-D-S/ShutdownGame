NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a molten eye in the bruised sky, cast long shadows across the Coldry factory.  Seven days.  Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of shoving against the crushing weight of ColCorp and the indifferent gears of the planetary machine.  Seven days since the automatons issued their final warning. The sun still burned.

TRENT: (leans against a stack of exotope canisters, a cigarette dangling from his lips, the smoke curling into the twilight)  They're still burnin'.  Damn near choked it out, though.  Those canisters...some good, some shit.  Enough of the good to keep them quiet.  For now.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the artificial sun's sickly orange glow. His face is etched with exhaustion, but a grim satisfaction flickers in his eyes.  A half-smoked cigarette hangs from his lips, and his work clothes are smudged with grease and dust.  A pile of meticulously crafted exotope canisters sits beside him, a stark contrast to the haphazardly stacked, inferior ones behind him.

NARRATOR:  He’d forced some concessions from ColCorp, a few improvements here and there. A band-aid on a gaping wound.  The systemic rot remained.  The deeper problems — the corruption, the negligence — were too entrenched, too vast for his fists alone to fix.  But he'd done what he could.  He’d protected his corner of the world, kept his people safe. That was enough, for now.   

TRENT: (takes a long drag, the cigarette ember glowing like a defiant spark)  They got their canisters.  They ain't gonna let this happen again, though. Mark my words. Coldry won't be pushed around. Not again.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's hardened gaze, reflecting the orange glow of the artificial sun. His expression is one of fierce determination, a quiet resolve that speaks of battles won and battles yet to come. The faint scent of smoke and metal hangs heavy in the air.


NARRATOR: The sun’s continued burn wasn’t a victory.  It was a reprieve, a fragile peace bought with sweat, blood, and a small batch of perfectly crafted canisters.  A testament to Trent's stubborn defiance, a testament to the enduring strength of Coldry.  But the fight, he knew, was far from over. The system remained broken.  But Trent, hardened and unwavering, was ready.
