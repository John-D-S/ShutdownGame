NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a weak but persistent ember in the bruised sky, casts a pale light across Coldry.  The rhythmic clang of the factory has returned, but it’s a different sound now – less frantic, more purposeful. Trent stands amidst the newly organized production line, his hands calloused but steady, his gaze sharp but less strained. The previous day's frantic effort to produce a batch of high-quality canisters hangs heavy in the air, a testament to his harsh methods and a fragile victory.

TRENT: (to a younger worker nervously tightening a canister seal)  Get it right.  One slip-up, and we all fry.  Remember what happened to Olsen?

NARRATOR:  He doesn't need to elaborate. The memory of the previous day's near-catastrophe, the threat of ColCorp's reprisal, serves as a potent reminder.  He reflects on the news of the sun's survival, a collective effort that didn't rely solely on his fists.  It was the union, the shared determination – a grudging acknowledgment of dependence he'd never truly understood.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight filtering through the factory window, watches a train carrying the vital canisters depart. His expression is unreadable, a blend of grim satisfaction and weary resolve. The faces of his coworkers in the background show similar complex expressions.

TRENT: (to himself, a low murmur)  They wouldn't have listened without… the show of strength.  But even the strongest man needs a team.  They all almost died. And for what?  A damned sun that would have kept burning if others hadn't been so busy backstabbing each other.

NARRATOR: The unspoken truth hangs in the air: the sun is on, but Ita remains a precarious balance on the edge of a knife.  Coldry's survival, Trent's survival, was secured, but the fundamental flaws within the system remain.  He knows the fight isn’t over, only paused. This victory tastes like ash in his mouth, the weight of responsibility pressing down harder than any ColCorp foreman ever could.  He turns, ready for the next challenge.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's calloused hands, one gripping a wrench, the other wiping sweat from his brow. His knuckles are white, his expression hardened, yet there is a flicker of something akin to weariness, a hint of doubt that he tries to mask. The dim factory setting serves as a backdrop to the weight of his unspoken anxieties.
