NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a pale imitation of its former glory, hangs weakly in the sky.  Dust motes dance in the weak light filtering through the Coldry factory’s grimy windows. Trent sits alone, the rhythmic clang of machinery replaced by a chilling silence.  The air hangs heavy with the metallic tang of unshipped canisters and the bitter taste of failure.  His fists are clenched, knuckles white against the worn wood of his workbench.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Unsustainable…that’s what Petrov called it.  Unsustainable.  Like I didn’t know.  Like I didn’t *feel* it in my gut, every goddamn faulty weld, every shortcut ColCorp forced down our throats.

NARRATOR: The news has trickled through – the sun’s still burning, a precarious, sputtering flame.  Shae, Crystal, Dax… their desperate efforts somehow held it together.  But Trent’s actions – his violent, misguided attempts at control – have left a scar.  The flow of canisters is crippled, production stalled, Coldry’s reputation tarnished. His defiance hasn’t brought about the order he craved; it’s sown chaos.

TRENT: (Slamming his fist on the workbench)  Control…strength… I thought it was the only way.  The only way to protect them, to protect *us*.  But all I did was break things.  I traded one kind of control for another.

NARRATOR: He stares out at the weak sunlight, a bleak understanding dawning in his eyes.  His stated belief – that strength and order are the only safeguards – now feels like a hollow lie. The quiet strength of his union brothers and sisters, their collective resilience – that’s what truly kept Coldry alive, not his rage. He’s not sure what comes next. But for the first time, a flicker of something other than rage stirs within him – a hesitant acceptance of vulnerability, a quiet hope for a different path.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak light of the artificial sun, his back to the camera.  His shoulders are slumped, but there's a stillness to his posture, suggesting a weary acceptance. The factory floor is largely empty, the atmosphere desolate.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Trent's hands, calloused and scarred, resting on the workbench. A single tear tracks a path through the grime on his cheek. The tear reflects the faint light of the artificial sun, mirroring the fragile hope that has begun to take root within him.
