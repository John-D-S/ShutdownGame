NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale imitation of the real thing, hangs heavy in the Coldry sky.  It’s a sickly yellow, not the vibrant white it should be, a constant reminder of the precariousness of their existence.  Seven days.  Seven days of fighting, of sweat and bruises, of defying ColCorp and their petty tyranny.  Seven days that ended with the successful launch of a shipment of properly-made exotope canisters, his union's defiant mark on a system built on lies.

TRENT: (Staring out at the weak sunlight, a hand resting on the scarred wood of his workbench)  They said it wouldn't work.  Said we were fools to fight back.  Said the automatons would crush us.  But the sun's still burning, ain't it?  Cracked, maybe, but burning.

NARRATOR: Trent surveys the Coldry factory, the air thick with the smell of metal and sweat, but the atmosphere is different.  A quiet pride, a hard-won peace hangs in the air. The relentless pressure, the constant fight for control, has left its mark, but in the quiet hum of the factory machinery, there's a newly forged sense of order – an order Trent and his union forged with their own hands.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight streaming through the factory window, looking out at the Coldry landscape.  His face is weary but resolute, his posture no less imposing, but there's a subtle softening around the eyes, a hint of something resembling contentment.  The factory floor around him is organized, functioning, a testament to his efforts.

TRENT: (To himself, almost a whisper)  Not enough.  Never enough.  But…for now…it holds.

NARRATOR: The news from the other city-states trickles in – a fragile patchwork of successes and failures.  Crystal, Shae, Dax…they fought their own battles. Their victories, like his, were hard-won, each a small dent in the vast, systemic rot that plagues Ita. The sun is on, but the fragility of it all weighs heavily on him.  The fight isn't over; it's just…paused.  For now.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Trent's calloused hands, one hand gently resting on the other.  A single, deep scar across his knuckles is visible, a testament to his struggles, but his grip is firm, unyielding.  The setting sun casts long shadows across his worn work gloves.

TRENT: (A grim smile touches his lips)  Let them try to take it again. They'll have another fight on their hands.
