NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a pale, weak disc in the bruised sky, stubbornly holds onto its light.  Coldry’s factory hums with a weary rhythm, the air thick with the lingering scent of sweat and fear. Trent, his usual intensity softened by exhaustion, leans against a repaired exotope canister, the metal cool against his calloused hand.  He watches the automatons' transport, a sleek, obsidian vessel, lift off from the Coldry launchpad, carrying the canisters he and his team secured.  The fragile success weighs heavily on him.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Six-point-eight-five.  Ain't perfect, but it'll hold… for now.

NARRATOR:  The news of the sun's continued operation trickles through the factory – a mix of relief and grim acceptance.  It's a testament to the combined, fractured efforts of Ita’s disparate city-states, a precarious balance held together by sheer grit and a last-minute scramble.  Trent's part – the secured canisters from Coldry – played a role in that fragile success. But the underlying issues—ColCorp's greed, the systemic failures— remain.

TRENT: (To a nearby worker, his voice gruff but tinged with a surprising weariness)  They think this is over. They’re wrong. This ain't a victory, it's a goddamn reprieve.  We need more than just holding on; we need to change things.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the setting sun, his face etched with exhaustion but a spark of defiant resolve in his eyes. The repaired exotope canisters gleam faintly in the failing light.  A group of union workers, their faces a mix of relief and apprehension, stand nearby.

NARRATOR:  The victory is bittersweet. Trent secured Coldry’s contribution, proving his strength and protecting his people. Yet, his stated belief – that only strength and control could ensure safety – remains a half-truth. He’s seen the system’s fragility, the necessity of imperfect alliances. The quiet hum of the factory might be quieter, but the deep-seated distrust, the systemic cracks, persist.  The fight, he knows, is far from over.  The reprieve bought them time, but the hard work of real change has only just begun.
