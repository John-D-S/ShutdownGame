NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale imitation of the life-giving star it was meant to be, had blinked out.  Darkness, thick and absolute, swallowed Coldry whole.  Trent, his face grime-streaked and bruised, stared at the extinguished sky.  The rhythmic clang of the factory, usually a comfort, was silenced, replaced by the chilling silence of a dying world.  He hadn't understood. He’d focused on his small corner, on ColCorp, on his immediate circle. The systemic failure, the vastness of the problem, had overwhelmed him. His fists, clenched tight, were useless against it.

TRENT: (A low growl, barely audible above the wind)  They… they didn’t listen.  Said it was just a few bad canisters.  A few…  It wasn’t enough.  My fault.  I shoulda… I shoulda…

NARRATOR:  The weight of his failure bore down on him.  His usual confidence, the strength he'd relied on, crumbled into ash.  His fierce loyalty, his protective rage, were impotent against the encroaching darkness.  He had fought for control, for order, but all he had achieved was a devastating collapse. The union, his allies, were scattered, defeated, their cries lost in the growing despair.  He'd protected his own, but that hadn't been enough. The larger system, the intricate web of interdependencies he had ignored, had broken.  It hadn't been just ColCorp.

# IMAGE: Trent sits alone amidst the rubble of the Coldry factory, the inky blackness of the sky a stark contrast to the orange glow of a dying fire he's managed to build. His face is etched with exhaustion and defeat, his normally defiant posture slumped.  A single, battered exotope canister rests at his feet.

TRENT: (Whispering, almost to himself)  Order… strength… it wasn’t enough.  Never was.  It was a lie.

NARRATOR:  The cold wind whipped around him, a stark reminder of the vulnerability he had always fought so fiercely to conceal.  His stated belief, his carefully constructed shield, had shattered, leaving him exposed to the harsh reality of his failure. The darkness was not just outside; it was inside him, too.


# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's calloused hands, one trembling slightly as he reaches for a half-empty canteen of water, his eyes fixed on the lifeless sky.  The image conveys a profound sense of loss and exhaustion, tinged with a flicker of something akin to…regret.
