NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale imitation of its former glory, still hung in the sky.  A weak, almost sickly light painted the Coldry factory in a jaundice hue.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of barely holding the line.  Trent leaned against a crate, the familiar ache in his muscles a dull counterpoint to the throbbing in his head.  The air, thick with the smell of sweat and metal, held a strange stillness.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Still on.  Damn thing's still on.

NARRATOR:  He hadn't stopped ColCorp completely.  The improved materials hadn't solved the systemic rot, the deep-seated corruption that had nearly plunged Ita into darkness. He'd made a dent, a bloody, bruised dent, but the fight was far from over.  He'd secured better materials for the *last* batch, but the damage was done.  Some compromised canisters, his own imperfect victory, were already out there.  The knowledge sat in his gut like a stone.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight filtering through the factory window. He looks weary, his face grimy, but there’s a stubborn defiance in his posture, a refusal to accept defeat.  Empty exotope canisters litter the floor around him.

TRENT: (To himself, voice low)  Not enough.  Never enough.  But it held. For now.

NARRATOR:  The union brothers and sisters were still with him, a testament to his defiance, his willingness to make a stand despite the overwhelming odds. It wasn't the complete control he craved, the iron grip on his environment. It was something else – a grudging respect, a shared survival.  A fragile peace.  For now.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Trent's calloused hands, one resting on the worn handle of a wrench, the other clenching a fist.  His knuckles are white, a testament to the tension he keeps tightly bottled inside.

TRENT: (A grim smile playing on his lips)  They’ll be back.  And next time… next time, we'll be ready.
