NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a once-blazing disc in the Ita sky, is now a cold, dark void.  A chilling wind whips through Coldry, carrying the dust of a dying world. Trent stands on the factory roof, the skeletal remains of the partially dismantled exotope canister production line a grim testament to his efforts. His usually stoic face is etched with grim determination, not the triumphant satisfaction he’d expected. The flickering emergency lights cast long shadows, emphasizing the emptiness around him.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Quality control... retrofitting...  We fixed *our* damn canisters.  But... it wasn't enough.

NARRATOR:  He looks out at the darkened city, the despair of the populace echoing the hollowness in his chest.  His hard-won victory, a small island of order in a sea of chaos, feels insignificant now. The weight of systemic failure crushes his defiant spirit, exposing the limitations of his brute force approach. The lies he told himself, about strength being the only answer, seem painfully obvious under this unforgiving darkness.  His stated belief that order and strength were enough is challenged by the utter lack of preparedness and coordination across Ita's city states.

TRENT: (A low growl) Lumina, Helios, that damn PSN… they all had a hand in this.  But…it was *everyone*.  We all failed to look beyond our own damn Coldry walls.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the dark sky, his shoulders slumped for the first time in a long while. The ruined factory line stretches behind him, a broken symbol of his incomplete victory.  A distant, faint flicker of light signifies the struggling emergency generators of Coldry.

NARRATOR:  Despite the crushing weight of failure, a flicker of something else—not hope, but a grim resolve—remains in his eyes. He clenches his fists, his resolve hardening. It wasn't enough this time, but maybe next time they might look past Coldry's borders before it's too late.  He begins to descend the factory steps, his gaze firm, his mind already strategizing for what comes next – a fight for survival that will transcend the walls of Coldry.

# IMAGE: Trent walking away from the factory towards Coldry's central emergency power station, his back to the dark sky, his figure small against the vastness of the city's despair. A determined set to his jaw shows his intent to move forward.
