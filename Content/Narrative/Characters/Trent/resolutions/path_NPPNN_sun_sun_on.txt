NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale, sickly yellow in the perpetual twilight of Coldry, cast long, distorted shadows across the factory floor.  Dust motes danced in the weak light, mirroring the turmoil in Trent’s gut. Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of trying to control the uncontrollable.  And what did it get him?

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, staring at a pile of rejected canisters)  Damn… faulty… all faulty.  

NARRATOR:  The union had offered tepid apologies; ColCorp had issued a perfunctory press release about unforeseen complications.  But the truth, cold and bitter, hung in the air like the smell of burnt exotope: his aggressive tactics, his refusal to see the systemic nature of the problem, had choked production, worsening the already desperate situation. The sun shone, yes, but only thanks to others, not his brute strength. The meager success felt like a defeat.

# IMAGE: Trent sits alone amidst a pile of rejected exotope canisters, his shoulders slumped, the weak sunlight highlighting the grime and exhaustion on his face.  Empty energy drink cans litter the floor around him.

TRENT: (Spitting on the floor)  Strength… control… bullshit.  It wasn’t enough.  Never is.  It’s always something bigger. Always.

NARRATOR:  He hadn't broken ColCorp, hadn't single-handedly saved Coldry.  The sun burned, a precarious flame held aloft by others' efforts, efforts he'd actively undermined.  His loyalty, his fierce protectiveness, had blinded him to the larger picture, leaving him isolated in his self-made defeat. The union's empty platitudes and ColCorp's shallow apologies mocked his shattered sense of control.  The strength he so valued, the control he craved, had been the very thing that crushed him.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of the Coldry factory, bathed in the weak, sickly light of the artificial sun.  Trent stands small and insignificant against the backdrop of the vast, oppressive structure, the shadow of his failure stretching long and dark.


NARRATOR: The sun's feeble light offered no comfort, only a stark reminder of his failure to bend the world to his will.  The victory was hollow, a testament to his flawed belief in the sufficiency of force. His rage had consumed him, leaving him only with a bitter taste of reality and the chilling awareness of his own limitations.  The fight, he realized with a sickening certainty, was far from over.
