NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly yellow disc in the bruised twilight sky, cast long shadows across the Coldry factory.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of forcing a system to bend to his will.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of exotope and the lingering scent of sweat and fear, held a fragile calm.  Trent, his hands calloused and scarred, leaned against a stack of perfectly-crafted exotope canisters – canisters *he* had ensured were strong enough to reach Sun Island.

TRENT: (To himself, voice low and gravelly)  They said it couldn't be done.  Said Coldry was broken, that we were… expendable.  They underestimated us.

NARRATOR: The news had trickled in, fragmented and distorted, like the sunlight itself: Crystal, Shae, Dax.  Each had wrestled their own demons, their own battles.  And against all odds, the sun remained.  It wasn't perfect, he knew.  A precarious balance held by the thread of their combined efforts.  The systemic rot remained, festering beneath the surface, but for now, the light remained.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, surveys the Coldry factory.  His face is grim, but a flicker of something akin to pride—a grudging respect for his own strength and the resilience of his community—plays in his eyes. The newly-organized and functional exotope canister line hums quietly in the background.

TRENT: (To a passing coworker, his voice still rough but softer than it had been)  Another batch ready?  Good.  Let's keep it moving.

NARRATOR:  The fight wasn't over.  He knew that.  ColCorp still lurked, the systemic flaws of Ita remained a constant threat.  But for tonight, for this moment, Trent allowed himself a small victory.  He’d held his ground, and the light held with him.  For now.
