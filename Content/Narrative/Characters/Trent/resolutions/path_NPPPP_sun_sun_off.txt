NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black sky, mirrored the hollowness in Trent's chest.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of forcing a system rigged against him to bend to his will.  He’d secured Coldry’s contribution; the canisters were sound, his union’s efforts a bulwark against ColCorp's greed.  But looking out at the encroaching darkness, the victory felt…small.  Pathetic, even.

TRENT: (A low growl, barely audible)  Damn it all.  We held our end. We *won*.  But it wasn't enough.

# IMAGE: Trent stands silhouetted against the starless sky, the cold wind whipping at his work clothes.  His face is grim, etched with exhaustion and a simmering frustration that hasn't entirely subsided.  In the foreground, a well-maintained, high-quality exotope canister rests – a testament to his efforts.

NARRATOR: The news had trickled down through the fractured communication lines: Lumina's sabotage, Helios's relentless profit-driven negligence, the PSN's lies.  Individual victories, he now understood, meant nothing against a tide of systemic failure.  His fierce loyalty, usually a source of strength, felt like a cage.  His control, once a shield, now seemed meaningless in the face of a catastrophe beyond his power to influence directly.

TRENT: (To himself, voice ragged)  Strength... control...  It wasn't enough.  Not this time.  

# IMAGE:  Close-up of Trent's hands, calloused and scarred, clenching a fist. His knuckles are white, betraying the internal struggle raging beneath the surface of his stoicism.

NARRATOR: The cold bit deeper now, a physical manifestation of the spreading despair. Yet, even in the face of utter darkness, a stubborn ember of defiance glowed within him. Coldry might be plunged into darkness, but it would be a Coldry *ready*, a Coldry *unified* in its resilience, forged in the crucible of this failure.  He'd find another fight. He always did.
