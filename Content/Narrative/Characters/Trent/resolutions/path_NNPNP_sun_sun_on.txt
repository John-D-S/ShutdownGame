NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale disc in the bruised twilight sky, cast long shadows across the Coldry factory.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of barely holding back the tide. The air, thick with the scent of metal and sweat, held a strange quiet – not the quiet of fear, but the quiet of exhaustion. Trent leaned against a still-warm canister, the metal biting into his calloused hand.  He hadn't saved Coldry single-handedly, not even close.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Partial victory… ain’t much of a victory at all.

NARRATOR:  The news had crackled over the union radio – the sun was still burning, somehow. A patchwork victory, born of efforts far beyond his own.  Crystal, Shae, Dax… their names tasted like ash in his mouth – a bitter reminder of his own limited impact.  He’d forced ColCorp to concede on some quality issues, but the deeper rot remained.  His fist clenched – a familiar, frustrated burn.  He’d made a dent, but the system, the goddamn *system*, had absorbed the blow and kept churning.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, his face etched with weariness and a simmering, unresolved anger.  Empty exotope canisters litter the ground around him, some slightly damaged.  In the distance, the artificial sun hangs low, a pale, uncertain light.

TRENT: (A low growl)  They’ll be back. They always are. This ain't over.

NARRATOR:  He knew, deep down, that true change wouldn't come from brute force alone.  But the knowledge brought little comfort.  The fight, the unending, exhausting fight, was all he knew.  And for now, at least, the sun still shone, a fragile, hard-won victory illuminating the long road ahead.

# IMAGE:  A close-up on Trent's calloused hand, gripping the worn wrench.  His knuckles are white, his gaze distant and grim, but a flicker of something akin to resolve sparks in his eye – a spark of defiance tempered by the weight of a hard-earned, incomplete victory.
