NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale imitation of the real thing, had winked out.  Coldry was plunged into an unnatural twilight, the air thick with the smell of dust and despair. Trent sat amidst the wreckage of the factory floor, the flickering emergency lights casting long, distorted shadows.  Faulty canisters lay scattered around him like fallen soldiers, a testament to his failed rebellion.  His arm, bandaged crudely, throbbed a dull rhythm against the silence.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, his voice raw)  Shoulda… shoulda just… smashed the whole damn place.  At least then… at least then *something* woulda been done.

NARRATOR:  His stated belief – that order and strength alone ensured safety – lay shattered.  The aggressive takeover had backfired spectacularly, crippling production, alienating his allies, and provoking a brutal ColCorp crackdown. He’d secured nothing, lost everything, and the sun was out.  His fierce loyalty hadn't protected anyone. The union was fractured, the workers subdued, and the city faced utter darkness.

# IMAGE: Trent, slumped against a damaged piece of machinery, his face etched with exhaustion and a bitter resignation.  The surrounding factory floor is in disarray, with broken equipment and discarded, faulty exotope canisters strewn everywhere.  The weak light of emergency lamps casts long, menacing shadows.

TRENT: (A low growl escaping his lips)  Damn ColCorp… damn Lumina… damn… everything. They all knew. They let it happen.  And me… I thought I could…

NARRATOR:  The weight of his failure crushed him. His fierce protectiveness had blinded him to the systemic rot, the subtle manipulations that outmatched his brute strength.  He’d focused on immediate control, missing the larger picture. The artificial sun's extinction was not a single act of sabotage but a consequence of everyone’s failures. His own included.  He had sought to control his environment, but the environment had crushed him in return.  His strength, his defiance, had been meaningless against the larger forces at play.
