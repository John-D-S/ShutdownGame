NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly yellow disc in the bruised sky, cast long shadows across the Coldry factory.  Dust motes danced in the weak light, mirroring the turmoil in Trent's gut. Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of defying. And for what?

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, staring at a pile of rejected exotope canisters)  Damn ColCorp…  Damn those weasels.  They knew. They had to know.

NARRATOR: The news had trickled down – the sun was still burning.  A precarious balance, they said.  Shae, Crystal, Dax…  Their struggles, their sacrifices…  had bought them time.  But Trent's contribution? His furious attempts to force quality control had only choked production, crippled the supply chain, and fueled ColCorp's already-rampant disregard for safety.  The union, already weakened, was further fractured by his actions.  He had fought for control, for order…and instead, he had sown chaos.

# IMAGE: Trent sits alone amidst a pile of rejected exotope canisters, the weak sunlight highlighting the dust motes swirling in the air. His face is grim, etched with exhaustion and a dawning understanding of his failure.  The factory looms behind him, a cold, uncaring monument to his struggle.

TRENT: (A low growl escapes his lips)  Control…  It wasn't about control. It was about…protecting them.  But I… I didn't protect anyone.  I only made things worse.

NARRATOR:  The weight of his failure pressed down on him, heavier than any ColCorp foreman’s threat. The sun might be shining, but the light felt cold, harsh, revealing the truth he had stubbornly refused to see: his strength, his defiance, had been misdirected. His stated belief – that order and strength were the only things that kept Coldry safe – had become a self-fulfilling prophecy of destruction. The quiet hum of the factory felt like a mocking reminder of his impotence.


# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's calloused hands, clenched into fists, the faint traces of dried blood barely visible beneath the grime. His eyes, though still fierce, hold a flicker of something akin to despair.


TRENT: (Whispers, barely audible) Maybe… maybe vulnerability isn't weakness after all.
