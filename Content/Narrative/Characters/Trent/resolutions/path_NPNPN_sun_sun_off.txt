NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky sky, mirrored the emptiness in Trent's gut.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of believing his strength alone could hold back the tide. Seven days that ended in crushing defeat. The factory, usually a bastion of controlled chaos, was silent, the air thick with the smell of dust and despair.  A thin layer of frost coated the ground – a stark reminder of Coldry’s harsh climate, now amplified by the dying warmth of their artificial sun.

TRENT: (To himself, voice low and gravelly)  They said it was my fault.  Said I didn't understand.  But they didn't understand the pressure, the constant fucking pressure to deliver, to produce, to obey.  They only saw the broken canisters, the halted production, the… the darkness. They didn't see ColCorp's hand in all of it, didn't see how they squeezed us dry.  

# IMAGE: Trent sits alone amidst the wreckage of the Coldry factory, the artificial sun a black hole in the twilight sky. His face, usually hard and unyielding, is etched with exhaustion and a flicker of something akin to… regret.  A discarded wrench lies near his calloused hand.

NARRATOR: The union was fractured, ColCorp triumphant.  His defiant acts, his forceful resistance, had not saved them. It had only accelerated their fall. The automatons, usually silent observers, were now a looming threat.  The whispers of their cold logic, their implacable drive to maintain the sun – a drive Trent had defied and failed – chilled him more than the encroaching cold.

TRENT: (Spitting on the ground)  Strength.  Control.  It wasn't enough.  Never enough.  Damn it all.

# IMAGE: A close-up shot of Trent's hands, calloused and scarred, now trembling slightly.  The faint light of a distant emergency lamp reflects in his eyes, revealing a haunting emptiness.  

NARRATOR: The world outside was plunged into a slow, agonizing freeze.  Trent, the man who believed only strength could bring order, was left with nothing but the bitter taste of failure and the chilling reality of his own limitations. His stated belief, the lie he had lived by, had crumbled, leaving behind only the harsh truth:  sometimes, even the strongest man cannot control the forces that seek to crush him.
