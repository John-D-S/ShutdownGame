NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly yellow disc in the hazy sky, offered no comfort.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of believing his strength alone could hold back the tide.  Seven days that ended in failure.  The clang of the Coldry factory, usually a defiant rhythm, now echoed the emptiness in Trent’s gut.  His forceful takeover had backfired spectacularly.  The Peacekeepers, called in by ColCorp, had crushed his rebellion, leaving a trail of injured workers and a mountain of unusable canisters.  The exotope flow to Sun Island had been further choked, his actions contributing to the precarious balance that kept Ita’s sun burning.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, staring at a cracked canister)  They… they didn’t understand.  They never do.  It was *their* negligence, *their* greed.  But… they won’t listen.  They *can’t* listen.  They only understand strength.  And I… I wasn’t strong enough.  Not this time.

# IMAGE: Trent sits alone amidst the wreckage of the factory, the setting sun casting long, mournful shadows.  His face is bruised, his clothes torn, but his gaze holds a stubborn defiance, though tinged with defeat.  Scattered around him are broken canisters and the remnants of his ill-fated rebellion.

NARRATOR: The news had trickled through – the sun was still burning. A fragile victory, born from the efforts of others, from compromises he hadn't been willing to make. The system, the damned, broken system, had somehow held. But the victory felt hollow, tainted by the bitter taste of his own inadequacy.  His stated belief – that order and strength alone brought safety – crumbled, replaced by a cold, hard truth.  He had fought, he had pushed, and in doing so, he had only amplified the chaos.

TRENT: (Spits on the ground) Strength ain’t enough.  Not when the rot is in the foundation.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's calloused hand, clenching a fist. A single tear tracks through the grime on his cheek, a silent testament to the unspoken vulnerability he’d failed to confront. The sun, a pale glimmer in the distance, offers no hope.
