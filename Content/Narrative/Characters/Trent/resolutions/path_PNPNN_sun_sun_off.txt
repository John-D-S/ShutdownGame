NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dying ember in the inky black sky, cast a cold, sickly light on the deserted Coldry factory.  Dust motes danced in the weak illumination, mirroring the turmoil in Trent's gut.  The silence, broken only by the occasional groan of settling metal, was heavier than any clang of machinery ever had been.  His bruised knuckles ached, a dull reminder of his futile struggle.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, his voice raspy)  Shoulda… shoulda…  

NARRATOR:  He kicked a discarded, dented exotope canister. It clattered against the concrete floor, the sound echoing the emptiness inside him. His stated belief, the lie he’d clung to – that strength and control were the only things that mattered – felt like ash in his mouth. He’d fought, he'd pushed, he'd raged… and he’d lost.  His defiance hadn't stemmed the tide of ColCorp's greed, the systemic failures of the city-states, or the relentless march of the impending darkness.

# IMAGE: Trent sits alone amidst the debris of the Coldry factory, the artificial sun a faint, dying glow in the sky. His face is etched with exhaustion and a dawning understanding, his fists clenched but no longer fueled by angry defiance.  Broken exotope canisters are scattered around him, symbolic of his failure.


TRENT: (A low growl escaping his lips)  They… they didn’t care.  About the workers… about the sun…  Just the bottom line.  

NARRATOR:  The truth, bitter and cold as the wind howling outside the factory, finally pierced through his carefully constructed walls of control.  His strength, his defiance, had been met not with compromise, but with an overwhelming, systemic failure that even his rage couldn't conquer. He hadn’t protected anyone; he hadn't even protected himself. The cold reality of the sun's extinction settled upon him, a crushing weight. The only light remaining was the faint glow of the dying sun and a spark of something he couldn't quite name – a flicker of regret, maybe, or something akin to… vulnerability.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Trent's face, illuminated by the weak light of the dying sun.  His expression is a complex mixture of exhaustion, regret, and a hint of something akin to understanding.  The harsh lines around his eyes hint at a life lived on the edge, but a shadow of something new, something unexpected, hints at the beginning of a different kind of strength.


TRENT: (Whispering)  Maybe… maybe there's another way.
