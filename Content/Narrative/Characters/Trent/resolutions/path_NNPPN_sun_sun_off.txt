NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the darkening sky, mirrored the hollowness in Trent's chest.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of forcing his will onto a system that refused to yield to brute strength.  The rhythmic clang of the Coldry factory was silent now, a ghost of the life that had been.  His union jacket, stained with grease and grime, felt heavy, a symbol of his failure.

TRENT: (Spitting on the ground, a gesture of disgust and defiance)  They called it a crisis.  A *systemic* crisis.  Like some damn disease you couldn't punch into submission.  Like you could just muscle your way through faulty exotope canisters and corporate greed.  

NARRATOR: He looked at the sky, a vast, empty canvas of approaching night, the faintest glimmer of starlight already piercing the deepening twilight. His efforts had been a drop in a poisoned ocean. Partially successful, yes.  He'd forced some improvements, exposed ColCorp's negligence.  But the deeper rot, the systemic failings, remained, festering beneath the surface.  Compromised canisters had made their way into the supply chain. His victories were pyrrhic. Coldry's contribution, like all the others, had been ultimately insufficient. 

# IMAGE: Trent silhouetted against the dying light of Ita's failed sun, his shoulders slumped, the empty factory behind him a testament to his struggle and its ultimate futility.  A single, broken exotope canister lies at his feet.


TRENT: (A low growl escaping his lips)  Order. Strength.  It's all bullshit.  All lies.  It wasn't enough.  Never enough.  

NARRATOR: The cold wind whipped around him, carrying the scent of ash and despair.  The familiar burn of anger was still there, but it was dulled, replaced by a chilling awareness of his own limitations.  He had fought, he had bled, but he had not won.  The sun was dead, and with it, a part of him died too. 


# IMAGE: A wide shot showing the Coldry factory and town in the twilight. The artificial sun is dark, and the city is plunged into early darkness.  A sense of desolation and quiet desperation pervades the scene.  Trent is a small figure in the foreground, his back turned, walking into the gloom.
