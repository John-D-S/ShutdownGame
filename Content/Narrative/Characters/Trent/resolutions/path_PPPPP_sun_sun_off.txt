NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black sky, mirrored the emptiness in Trent's gut.  Coldry huddled beneath a thin, brittle blanket of starlight, the silence broken only by the occasional groan of the factory, a wounded beast left to rust.  He stood on the roof of his workshop, the half-finished, retrofitted exotope canisters scattered around him – a testament to his success, a mocking reminder of its inadequacy.

TRENT: (Spitting on the ground)  Damn ColCorp.  Damn Lumina.  Damn everyone who didn’t do their goddamn job.  My canisters were good.  Perfect, even.  But it wasn't enough.  Never enough.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the star-filled sky, his face grim and set, his hands calloused and stained with grease.  Scattered around him are the meticulously crafted exotope canisters, a stark contrast to the bleak landscape.

NARRATOR: The truth, bitter and harsh as the wind whipping across the frozen highlands, hit him: strength alone couldn't fix a broken system. His defiance, his control, his furious resistance – it had all been focused on the immediate, the tangible. He'd battled ColCorp, forced them to improve, but the systemic rot ran deeper.  The sabotage, the mismanagement, the lies—they’d overwhelmed even his best efforts.  The fragile hope that sparked when the Coldry canisters left the factory had flickered and died, swallowed by the encroaching darkness.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself) Order… strength…  It wasn't enough.  Never enough. Maybe… maybe vulnerability wasn't weakness after all.  Maybe… working together…

# IMAGE: A close-up of Trent's face, etched with exhaustion and a hint of something else – a flicker of something resembling understanding, perhaps even regret. The cold starlight reflects in his hardened eyes.

NARRATOR:  The weight of the planet’s failure pressed down on him, heavier than any factory press. Yet, in the crushing darkness, a different kind of strength began to stir—a quiet, grim resolve born not of brute force, but of a bitter acceptance.  He would fight on, but this time, differently.  He would fight for something beyond his immediate grasp, something beyond the strength of a single man. He would fight for a different kind of order, one built not on control, but on trust. The fight for Ita's sun was lost, but the fight for Ita itself had just begun.
