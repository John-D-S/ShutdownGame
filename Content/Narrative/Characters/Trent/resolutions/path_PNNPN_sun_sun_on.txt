NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly yellow orb in the perpetually twilight sky, cast long, distorted shadows across the wreckage of Coldry’s factory floor.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of struggling against the tide of ColCorp's greed and the systemic rot eating away at Ita. Seven days that ended in bitter failure.

TRENT: (Spitting on the cracked concrete)  They called it insubordination.  Insubordination.  Like I didn't know what I was doing.  Like I didn't care about Coldry.

# IMAGE: Trent, his face grimy and bruised, leans against a twisted metal beam, the wreckage of the factory a testament to his failed rebellion.  Empty, dented exotope canisters litter the ground, a stark symbol of his failure to ensure quality production. The weak sunlight barely illuminates his despair.


NARRATOR: The sun still burns, they say.  Shae, Dax, Crystal... they patched things up.  Held it together.  But at what cost?  His forceful takeover, his reckless defiance… it all backfired. The canisters, the flawed ones, the ones he’d *fought* for… they hadn’t been enough.  The production line remains crippled, a symbol of his overwhelming failure.  Coldry is weaker than ever.

TRENT: (A low growl rumbling in his chest)  Strength.  Control.  It wasn't enough.  Order… it’s just a lie.  A damn lie.  And the weak… they're still suffering.  Only now, it’s because *I* failed.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent’s hand, calloused and scarred, clutching a dented exotope canister. His knuckles are white, his grip tight, a testament to his lingering desperation and the weight of his failure.  The sun, a weak and uncertain light, barely reaches the gloom of this scene.

NARRATOR:  The quiet hum of the failing factory was a dirge, a grim requiem for his blind rage, and a stark reminder of the limitations of his strength against the crushing weight of a system too broken to be fixed by fists alone. The sun might be burning, but for Trent, a cold, hollow darkness had settled in its place.
