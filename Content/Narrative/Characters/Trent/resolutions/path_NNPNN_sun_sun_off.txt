NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a malevolent eye in the darkening sky, is dead.  Seven days. Seven days of escalating chaos, of his own furious efforts to control the uncontrollable, and ultimate, crushing failure. Coldry is plunged into an icy twilight, the factory a skeletal monument to his futile struggle.

TRENT: (Spitting on the frozen ground, his breath clouding in the frigid air)  They said it was the canisters.  Faulty.  My fault.  But it wasn't just me.  It was *them*, ColCorp, squeezing every drop of profit until the whole damn system collapsed.  And I let them. I should have… I should have…

NARRATOR: The words die in his throat, choked by the bitter reality.  His fists clench, but the familiar surge of anger is muted, replaced by a bone-deep exhaustion.  The strength he so fiercely clung to feels… brittle.

# IMAGE: Trent, hunched and alone amidst the snow-covered ruins of the Coldry factory.  His normally intense gaze is vacant, his shoulders slumped, the wrench he carries now a useless weight in his numb hands.  The artificial sun, a cold, dark void in the sky, hangs like a grim judgment.


TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Order… strength…  It wasn't enough.  It never is.

NARRATOR:  The lie, the shield he built against vulnerability, crumbles with the dying light. The weight of his failure, the collective failure of Ita, crushes him beneath its weight.  There’s no rallying cry left, no fight to be fought. Only the chilling silence of a world plunged into darkness.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Coldry, shrouded in shadow under the lifeless artificial sun.  Smoke rises from the factory chimneys, a pathetic whisper in the growing cold. The scene is desolate, highlighting the profound scale of the failure, and Trent's insignificance within it.
