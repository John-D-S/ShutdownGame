NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale imitation of the real thing, hung in the sky, a weak but persistent glow.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of barely clinging to control.  Trent stood on the Coldry factory roof, the wind whipping his worn work clothes around him.  Below, the factory hummed with a grudging efficiency, a testament to his – and his fellow workers' – stubborn resistance.  He'd forced some concessions from ColCorp, exposed their shoddy practices. But it hadn't been enough.  The deeper problems, the systemic rot, remained.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself, staring at the distant Sun Island)  Damn ColCorp.  Damn Lumina.  Damn the whole blasted system.  They almost took it all. Almost.

NARRATOR:  He thought of the faulty canisters, the compromised shipments, the risk they'd taken.  The bruises on his knuckles throbbed, a dull reminder of the fight.  He hadn't achieved complete control, never had.  But he'd held his ground.  He’d protected his own, and that's all that mattered. That and the fact the damn sun was still up.  For now.

TRENT: (A flicker of something akin to pride in his eyes)  We held them off. This time.

NARRATOR:  He clenched his fist, the strength in his grip a defiant testament to his resilience. The sun was still shining, a fragile victory bought with sweat, blood, and the unyielding assertion of his will. It was a stalemate, a fragile peace, but in Trent's world, a stalemate was a victory in itself. It confirmed his belief – flawed as it was – that strength was all that stood between his people and oblivion. The fight, however, wasn't over.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, stands with his back to the camera, overlooking the Coldry factory. The expression on his face is one of weary determination, a mixture of exhaustion and grim satisfaction.  In the distance, the artificial sun hangs precariously in the sky, its light a pale imitation of its former glory.
