NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black sky, mirrored the hollowness in Trent's chest.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of forcing concessions from ColCorp, only to watch as the light bled out of Ita's sky.  The factory, usually a bastion of controlled chaos, was eerily silent.  The rhythmic clang of metal on metal was replaced by the mournful creak of the building settling under the weight of despair.  He’d forced some improvements, squeezed some better materials from ColCorp, but it wasn't enough.  Not nearly enough.

TRENT: (His voice, usually a gravelly bellow, is low, almost a whisper)  Damn…damn it all to hell.

NARRATOR: He looked at the pile of exotope canisters, some bearing the faintly reassuring mark of improved quality, others still marked with the telltale signs of ColCorp's cost-cutting measures.  The partially successful strike, the temporary production halt – they were meaningless now, pyrrhic victories in the face of complete failure. His carefully measured control, his brutal efficiency, had been dwarfed by forces far larger than he could comprehend or combat.  The systemic rot, the bureaucratic inertia, the corporate greed – these weren’t things he could punch into submission.


# IMAGE: Trent sits alone amidst the cold, dark machinery of the Coldry factory, his shoulders slumped, the dead artificial sun visible through a grimy window.  His hands are calloused and dirt-stained, but they are still, unclenched for the first time in days, a rare display of exhaustion.  A single, flickering oil lamp casts long, distorted shadows on the walls.

TRENT: (To himself, barely audible)  Strength…control…it wasn’t enough.  Never was.  They’ll find a way… somehow.  They always do.  But it ain't gonna be me this time.

NARRATOR:  The weight of his failure, the crushing realization that even his brutal efficiency couldn't overcome the systemic flaws, settled heavily on him.  The icy wind of Coldry howled outside, a mournful dirge for the dying world.  He'd fought for order, for strength, and all he'd managed was to delay the inevitable.  The bitter taste of defeat was far more potent than any victory he had ever known.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of the Coldry factory, dwarfed by the immense, cold expanse of the night sky, the dead artificial sun hanging like a malevolent eye in the blackness.  The factory is a single point of light against the overwhelming darkness, a fragile symbol of humanity’s failure in the face of a far greater power.  The image is almost entirely devoid of warm colors, emphasizing the cold, harsh reality of Ita's fate.
