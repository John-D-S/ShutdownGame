NARRATOR: The sky is a bruised purple, the air thick with the chill of a dying world.  Trent sits hunched on a crate outside the Coldry factory, the rhythmic clang of machinery replaced by an unsettling silence. The artificial sun, a once-constant source of life, is extinguished.  Dust motes dance in the weak, fading light of the dying planet.  He stares blankly at the factory, its dark windows reflecting the grim reality of his failure.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Shoulda…shoulda…  Damn ColCorp.  Damn those weasels.  They knew. They *always* know.

NARRATOR:  His fists clench, the knuckles bone-white under his grime-covered skin. The anger, the familiar rage that has fueled him for so long, is now a hollow ache, a dull throbbing behind his eyes.  His stated belief – that strength and control were the only guarantees of safety – crumbles under the weight of his failure.  He failed to protect Coldry, failed to control the outcome, failed even to understand the systemic rot that consumed it all. The confrontation, the brute force, the righteous fury, it all amounted to nothing in the face of corporate greed and systemic sabotage.

# IMAGE: Trent, his back slumped against a crate, his face grim and drawn. The factory behind him is dark and lifeless, the sky a bleak purple. A single, flickering emergency light casts a harsh shadow across his face.  Empty exotope canisters are scattered around him, a stark reminder of his failed efforts.

TRENT: (A low growl escapes his lips)  They'll pay…they’ll all pay.  But what good is that now?  The sun's out.  Everything's…done.

NARRATOR:  The weight of his inaction hangs heavy, heavier than the cold that seeps into his bones.  His protective instincts, his fiercely loyal heart, are now consumed by a crushing, almost unbearable grief. The strength he once wielded feels insignificant, a pathetic shield against the inevitable.  The bitter taste of defeat lingers, a harsh reminder that even the strongest man can be broken by a system he doesn't understand.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's calloused hands, clenched into fists, the faint trace of blood from a previous scuffle staining his knuckles.  His gaze is fixed on the dark, lifeless factory, his eyes reflecting the dying light of Ita's artificial sun.  A single tear, unnoticed, traces a path through the grime on his cheek.


NARRATOR:  The silence is broken only by the distant, mournful wail of the wind. The finality of it all settles upon him, cold and absolute. He's lost. Coldry is lost. Ita is lost. And within the crushing weight of his failure, Trent is left with only the cold truth of his stated belief. It was a lie, and the consequences have been catastrophic.  His rage now serves no purpose. Only the gnawing emptiness remains.
