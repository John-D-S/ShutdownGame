NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a pale, wavering disc in the sky, stubbornly holds.  Dust motes dance in the weak light filtering through the Coldry factory window.  Trent, his hands calloused and stained with grease, leans against a newly-fabricated exotope canister, its gleaming surface a stark contrast to the grime surrounding him.  He’s exhausted, but a grim satisfaction settles over his features.  The rhythmic clang of the factory has returned, but now it’s a beat of hard-won victory.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Damn near broke my back… and my knuckles.  But they're holding.

NARRATOR: The news of the sun's continued operation trickles into the factory; a hesitant cheer erupts among the workers, a wave against the backdrop of exhaustion. Trent remains stoic, his gaze fixed on the canister. He knows this reprieve is fragile, a testament to sheer grit and brute force, not a sign of systemic change. He knows the fragile balance the world now rests on.

TRENT: (To a nearby coworker, his voice low and gruff)  They think this fixes things.  It doesn't.  ColCorp's still breathing, the suits in Confluence are still scheming... and those damn automatons... they're just waiting for the next screw-up.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak light of the artificial sun, gazing out the factory window at the dust-choked Coldry landscape.  A single, newly-made exotope canister rests beside him, a symbol of his hard-won victory and the ongoing struggle.

NARRATOR:  But in that weary gaze, there’s also a flicker of something else – a reluctant pride, a stubborn refusal to break. He hasn't solved the problems of Ita, but he's bought Coldry some time, he's secured his piece of the fragile peace.  His stated belief is still a lie, the core urge a constant companion, but today, his defiance has earned a momentary reprieve. The fight continues.

# IMAGE: Close-up of Trent's hand, calloused and scarred but firm, resting on the polished surface of the exotope canister. The faint reflection of the wavering sun catches in his hardened gaze.

TRENT: (A near whisper)  For now, they'll leave us alone.  For now… we’re safe.
