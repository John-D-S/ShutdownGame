NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black sky, mirrored the hollowness in Trent's chest.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of forcing control where control was impossible.  Coldry's portion of the exotope crisis was, for now, staved off. His union’s rigorous quality control, his relentless drive, had secured a temporary reprieve – a small, defiant victory in the face of overwhelming odds.  But the darkness pressing down was undeniable.  The meager success felt insignificant against the vastness of Ita's failure.

TRENT: (grunting, hands calloused and stained with grease, he grips a half-empty canteen)  Damn Lumina… damn Helios… damn that PSN lying sack of shit.  All that work… for nothing.  Almost.

NARRATOR: He looked at the small group of weary workers huddled around a meager fire, their faces etched with exhaustion and despair.  Their defiant unity was starting to unravel.  The fragile hope they’d found in his strength faltered under the weight of the oppressive darkness.  Trent, usually so ready to confront, found himself at a loss.  His usual methods—force, direct action—were meaningless against the systemic failures that plunged Ita into this abyss. The weight of their shared vulnerability, a weakness he’d always fiercely suppressed, pressed down on him.

TRENT: (muttering to himself, the raw edge of exhaustion seeping into his voice)  Order… strength… it wasn’t enough. It never was.  Never will be.

NARRATOR: The flickering flames reflected in his eyes, hinting at a flicker of something besides anger.  A weariness that wasn’t just physical, but a deeper, more unsettling exhaustion born of a realization that true safety wasn't about controlling everything, but accepting the limits of his control.  The fight wasn’t over, not by a long shot. But this cold, black night showed him he couldn't do it alone. He couldn't control the universe.
