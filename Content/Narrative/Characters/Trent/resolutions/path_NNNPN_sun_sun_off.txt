NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, black eye in the inky sky, mirrored the emptiness in Trent's gut.  Coldry was shrouded in a twilight gloom, the familiar rhythmic clang of the factory replaced by an unnerving silence.  The air hung heavy with the stench of failure and the bitter taste of ash.  His fist, bruised and raw, clenched around a discarded, faulty exotope canister – a testament to his own violent, ultimately futile efforts.

TRENT: (A low growl, more a rasp than words)  They… they wanted a fight.  They got one.  And what did it get us?  Nothing.

NARRATOR:  The news had spread like wildfire – the sun was dead.  The whispers of ColCorp's sabotage, fueled by his own failed attempt at forceful control, had been drowned out by the overwhelming reality of Ita's impending doom.  His desperate gambit to assert control, to protect Coldry, had not only failed but directly contributed to the catastrophe.  The Union Peacekeepers, their authority now seemingly absolute, patrolled the darkening streets, adding another layer to his crushing defeat.

# IMAGE: Trent sits alone amidst the debris of the ColCorp quality control section, the shattered remains of exotope canisters scattered around him like broken bones. The artificial sun is a black void above, reflecting the darkness he feels within.

TRENT: (To himself, a bitter chuckle escaping his lips) Strength. Control.  Lies.  All lies.  It wasn't enough.  Never enough.

NARRATOR:  The fierce loyalty he felt for Coldry, his desperate need to protect his people, was now a suffocating weight, pressing down on him like the approaching cold. His stated belief – that order and strength were the only things keeping them safe – had crumbled, leaving behind only the bitter taste of his failure.  His usual anger was replaced by a chilling sense of profound, desolate exhaustion.  The fight was over.  And he had lost.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Coldry, plunged into twilight under a lifeless artificial sun.  Trent stands alone in the foreground, his back turned towards the camera, a solitary figure swallowed by the encroaching darkness. His silhouette is stark and defeated against the ominous sky.

TRENT: (Almost a whisper)  Maybe… maybe weakness wasn't the enemy after all.
