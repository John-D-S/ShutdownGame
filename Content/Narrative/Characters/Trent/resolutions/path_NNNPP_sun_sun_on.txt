NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a pale but persistent disc in the hazy Coldry sky, casts long shadows across the repaired exotope canisters stacked high in the factory.  The air, thick with the scent of metal and sweat, hums with a subdued energy – a tired defiance rather than the explosive rage of the past week. Trent, his face grimy but his posture less rigidly tense, leans against a workbench, the wrench he’s wielded so fiercely for the past week lying discarded at his feet.  He watches his team, exhausted but satisfied, finally breaking for a meager meal.

TRENT: (To himself, a low growl)  Held.  Barely.  They still won’t admit the canisters are shit, just that *we* managed to make them work.  ColCorp’s still breathing, sucking the life out of this place.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight filtering through the factory windows, stares out at the partially repaired sky. His face is etched with exhaustion and a grim satisfaction, his posture less rigid than before.  Empty food rations and discarded tools are scattered around him. The repaired exotope canisters are stacked neatly in the foreground.

NARRATOR: News trickles in – fragmented, unreliable, as always – about the sun. It’s on.  Holding.  A fragile victory, bought by the sweat and grit of countless individuals, each battling their own demons and systemic failures. The system remains broken, deeply flawed.

TRENT: (To a weary coworker, his voice rough but quieter than usual) Sun's up. For now.  Don't think this fixes anything.  But we bought ourselves some time.  Maybe… enough to start tearing this whole rotten system down.  Piece by piece.

# IMAGE:  Close-up on Trent's hands, calloused and scarred, but now holding a half-eaten piece of hardtack. His gaze is distant, focused not on the food, but on the distant artificial sun, a flicker of something like hope in his eyes.

NARRATOR: The victory is bitter, earned at a terrible cost.  But in Trent’s eyes, a quiet resolve burns – not the furious defiance of the besieged, but the steely determination of a man who knows the fight is far from over, and he’s ready for the next round.  The sun may be on, but the fight for Coldry, and for Ita, has just begun.
