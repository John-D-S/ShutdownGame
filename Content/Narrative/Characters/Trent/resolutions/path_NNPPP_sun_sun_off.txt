NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black sky, mirrored the emptiness in Trent's gut.  The factory, usually a cacophony of noise and exertion, was eerily silent, the air thick with the smell of burnt metal and ozone.  He stood amidst the wreckage, his union jacket torn, a smear of grime across his cheek.  The hastily-repaired canisters, a testament to his frantic efforts, lay scattered around him.  His success, a bitter victory.

TRENT: (grunting, rubbing his aching knuckles)  Damn… we held our ground.  Coldry didn't break.

NARRATOR: He looked up at the starless expanse, his gaze hardening.  His earlier triumph, securing the exotope canisters, felt insignificant against the overwhelming darkness.  The knowledge that his efforts, despite their efficacy, were not enough to save Ita weighed heavily on him. The lies he’d told himself – the belief that strength alone could guarantee safety – now felt hollow and inadequate. The systemic rot, the corruption, the political maneuvering, those were forces he couldn't control with fists or wrench.

TRENT: (a low growl)  Not enough... never enough.  It's always something else.  More than one man can handle.

NARRATOR: A flicker of something akin to vulnerability, a crack in his hardened exterior, showed for a fleeting moment in his eyes before he masked it again with his usual steely resolve. The fight wasn't over; it had just changed.

# IMAGE: Trent silhouetted against the dark sky, the dead sun a pale circle behind him. His face is grim, but his posture is defiant, a clenched fist raised towards the heavens. His expression suggests a blend of exhaustion and grim determination.

TRENT: (to himself, almost a whisper)  We’ll rebuild.  We'll find a way.  But next time… next time they won’t be ready.


# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's calloused hand, gripping a still-warm, slightly damaged exotope canister.  A single tear streaks through the grime on his cheek, unnoticed.
