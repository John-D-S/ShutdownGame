NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly yellow disc in the bruised sky, cast long shadows across the Coldry factory.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy windows.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of shoving against the tide of ColCorp's greed and the looming threat of eternal night.  Trent leaned against a newly-reinforced exotope canister, the metal cool against his calloused hand.  The air, thick with the smell of sweat and exertion, held a strange quiet, different from the usual tense hum of the factory.  It wasn't the quiet of defeat, but the quiet of exhaustion, of a battle hard-won.

TRENT: (to himself, voice rough)  They said it couldn't be done.  Said the canisters were shit, the whole damn system was rigged.  Said we were too small, too weak. They were wrong.

# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight pouring through a factory window. He's covered in grime and sweat, but his posture is relaxed, a rare sign of contentment etched onto his weary face.  Behind him, the factory hums with controlled efficiency; workers move with a newfound sense of purpose.

NARRATOR:  The retrofitting was brutal.  Days and nights bled into each other, fuelled by adrenaline and black coffee.  But they did it. His union, his people, they proved their strength. They didn't just survive; they secured a piece of the future, a precarious but real victory.  The sun was still on, flickering maybe, strained, but on.  He'd heard the whispers – Crystal, Shae, Dax, somehow, against all odds, they’d all held their ground.  A fragile coalition of strength against the systemic rot.  It wasn't perfect, far from it.  The system was still broken, ColCorp was still lurking, the shadows of Lumina and Helios still stretched long.  But for now, Coldry breathed, and the sun shone, however weakly.

TRENT: (to a passing worker, a gruff nod)  Another batch ready.  Make sure it's perfect, Krill.  No shortcuts.  We’re not taking any chances.

# IMAGE: Trent, his face grim but resolute, overseeing a line of workers carefully assembling exotope canisters.  The canisters are visibly stronger and more durable than those produced before the crisis, reflecting the improved quality control Trent implemented.

NARRATOR: The fight wasn't over. Trent knew that.  But for now, in the weak light of the artificial sun, he allowed himself a moment of grim satisfaction.  He had secured his own survival, and the survival of those under his protection, proving once more that strength, under the right circumstances, could indeed stave off chaos.  It wasn't the order he craved, but it was something resembling it, hard won and brutally earned.  And maybe, just maybe, that was enough. For now.
