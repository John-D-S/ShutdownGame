NARRATOR:  The artificial sun, a pale but persistent disc in the sky, cast a weak light over Coldry.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing back against the crushing weight of ColCorp, of the suffocating fear of the dying sun.  Seven days that had changed everything.  Trent stood on the factory roof, the biting wind whipping at his worn jacket.  Below him, the factory hummed with a renewed, if strained, energy. His union brothers and sisters, exhausted but resolute, were still working, their faces grim but determined.


TRENT: (To himself, a low growl)  Still ain't perfect.  Those canisters...they're holding, for now. But the system…it's still a goddamn mess.


NARRATOR:  He looked towards the horizon, where the faint glow of the artificial sun offered a fragile promise.  He'd fought, he'd won a battle, but the war – the systemic rot that had nearly snuffed out their world – remained.  His success had been narrow, a band-aid on a gaping wound. The knowledge of the precarious balance – Crystal, Shae, Dax, and himself holding it all together – settled on him like a cold weight.  His stated belief – that only strength and control ensured safety – had been partially proven, but the truth was far more complex and far less reassuring.


# IMAGE: Trent, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, his face a mixture of weariness and grim determination.  The Coldry factory stretches below him, a symbol of both his victory and the ongoing struggle.


TRENT: (Muttering)  Control…it ain't everything.  But goddamn, it helps.


NARRATOR: He clenched his fist, the worn metal of his union ring a cold comfort against the chill wind. The sun was on, for now. But the fight, he knew, was far from over.  The fragility of their world, the deep-seated corruption, would need far more than brute strength to truly overcome.  He just hoped they had the time.
