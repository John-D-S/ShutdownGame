NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale ghost in the darkening sky, had finally blinked out.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of believing his strength alone could save Coldry, and he'd failed.  The factory, usually a cacophony of noise, was eerily silent, a monument to his defeat. Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through grimy windows.

TRENT: (Spitting on the floor, the sound sharp in the silence)  Petrov's promises were lies.  Empty words.  Like all the rest.  They kept churning out those goddamn canisters, shoddy work, all for ColCorp's greed.  I should have… I should have…

NARRATOR:  The weight of his failure pressed down on him, crushing the defiant posture he'd cultivated for so long. His hands, usually calloused and strong, trembled slightly as he gripped his wrench. The bitter taste of defeat was far worse than any physical pain.  He'd focused on brute force, on immediate control, and missed the systemic rot, the web of corporate corruption that had strangled Ita. His loyalty and protection had only served to reinforce the system's flaws.

# IMAGE: Trent sits alone amidst the debris of the Coldry factory, the wrench lying uselessly beside him. The artificial sun is absent from the sky, replaced by the cold expanse of space, visible through the factory's broken windows. His face is etched with exhaustion, defeat, and a dawning understanding of his own limitations.  A single tear tracks through the grime on his cheek.

TRENT: (Muttering to himself)  Strength… it ain't enough.  Control… it's an illusion.  Order… it was a lie all along.  They all broke it, and I couldn't stop them.  Coldry… we're all going to freeze.

NARRATOR: The chilling darkness outside mirrored the icy despair closing in on him.  His fierce protectiveness had blinded him; his attempts to control the uncontrollable had only hastened the end. The cold truth settled over him, heavy and inescapable: his stated belief, his whole life's foundation, was nothing but a self-deception. He hadn't protected anyone.

# IMAGE: A close-up shot of Trent's hands, calloused and scarred, now resting limply in his lap. His gaze is fixed on the wrench, a symbol of his futile struggle against a system far larger and more complex than he ever understood.
