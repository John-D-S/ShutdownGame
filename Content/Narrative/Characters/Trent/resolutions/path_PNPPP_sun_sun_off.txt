NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black sky, mirrored the chill in Trent's heart.  Seven days. Seven days of fighting, of pushing, of forcing a system that was rigged against him to bend to his will.  He’d secured the canisters, ensured Coldry's contribution wasn't a total failure.  But it hadn't been enough.  The factory stood silent, a monument to his futile struggle.  The air, usually thick with the metallic tang of exotope and sweat, now carried only the bitter bite of the encroaching cold.

TRENT: (His voice a low growl, the usual bluster replaced by a weary exhaustion)  Damn it all to hell.  I did what I could.  I *made* them do what they should have done.  But... (He kicks at a loose piece of metal, sending sparks flying) ... it wasn't enough.  This wasn't about some fancy political games; it was about keeping the lights on.  Keeping Coldry alive.  And I failed.

# IMAGE: Trent stands alone amidst the wreckage of a Coldry factory, silhouetted against the star-strewn void where the artificial sun should be. His face is grim, etched with exhaustion and a hard-won understanding of his own limitations.  The remnants of his successful canister operation – a few still-intact containers – are scattered amongst the debris.

NARRATOR:  The weight of the planet's failure settled on him, heavy and inescapable.  His stated belief – that strength and control were all that mattered – felt like ash in his mouth.  The cold pressed down, but it wasn't just the physical cold. It was the icy realization that his strength, his defiance, had been a drop in a vast, systemic ocean of corruption and incompetence.  He had fought the immediate battles, won some skirmishes, but the war was lost. Yet, a flicker of something else remained – a stubborn refusal to surrender, even in defeat.

TRENT: (To himself, a quiet murmur barely audible above the wind)  There's still… something. Something to salvage.  Coldry might be dark, but we're still here.  And we'll find a way.  We always do.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Trent's clenched fist, his knuckles white.  In the background, the faint glow of a small fire in a makeshift shelter is visible, a symbol of enduring Coldry resilience.  The artificial sun remains absent, yet a tiny spark of defiance ignites within Trent’s resolve.
