NARRATOR: The flickering sun casts long, unsettling shadows across the Coldry factory floor. ColCorp's foreman, a weasel of a man named Harv, is pushing for even cheaper materials â€“ a blatant disregard for safety. Trent feels the familiar pressure building, a simmering rage against those who would exploit Coldry's workers.

    NARRATOR: Trent's intimidating presence and the threat of a union strike prove effective. Harv, sweating and pale, backs down, promising to use the approved materials.  A tense but temporary victory.

    NARRATOR: Harv, emboldened by ColCorp's backing and Trent's perceived isolation (given the recent union setbacks), calls Trent's bluff, claiming the 'better' canisters are unavailable due to the crisis. He reports Trent's 'incitement' to higher management. Trent's anger explodes, but it's a poorly targeted rage.
    # IMAGE: Trent, fists clenched, facing a smug Harv who smirks, security guards closing in, the factory floor a blur of motion and anxiety.
