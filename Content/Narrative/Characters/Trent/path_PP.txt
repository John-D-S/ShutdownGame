NARRATOR: The flickering sun casts long, jittery shadows across the Coldry factory floor. ColCorp's foreman, a weasel-faced man named Harv, keeps pushing for faster production, even as the quality of the exotope canisters plummets.  Trent feels the pressure building, a familiar tightness in his chest.

    NARRATOR: Harv, caught off guard by Trent's raw intensity and the simmering anger of the other workers, backs down. He promises to petition ColCorp for better resources, at least temporarily.  The workers, emboldened, maintain a slower, safer pace.

    NARRATOR: Harv, unmoved by Trent's threat, calls in security.  A brawl ensues, leaving Trent bruised but defiant, and the factory shut down for the day. The union's position is weakened.  The substandard materials continue to be used.
