    NARRATOR: Trent's confrontation escalates into a violent argument. The foreman, backed by ColCorp security, calls Trent's bluff.  The union offers no overt support; they fear the repercussions of outright defiance. Trent is suspended, and substandard canisters continue to roll off the production line.
