NARRATOR: The flickering sun casts long, distorted shadows across the Coldry factory floor. Trent, sweat beading on his brow, grips a dented exotope canister. ColCorp's foreman, a weasel-faced man named Barlow, keeps demanding more, faster, regardless of the quality.  The automatons' warnings echo in Trent's mind, a low, insistent hum of impending doom.
