    NARRATOR: The rave explodes. Thousands gather, drawn by the raw energy of Crystal's performance and the defiant spirit of the event.  The sheer scale of the party forces Helios to acknowledge the public anger and the precarious state of the city's power grid.  The blackout is averted as a temporary truce is called.

    NARRATOR:  Helios security forces crack down hard on the rave before it gains real momentum. Crystal's hastily assembled equipment malfunctions, leading to a chaotic scramble and a spectacular power surge that leaves the refinery in flames. The party ends in a blaze of frustration and near disaster, failing to expose Helios or truly galvanize the population.  The blackout hits even harder as a result of the refinery's destruction.
    # IMAGE: Security forces clashing with revelers amidst smoke and flames billowing from the destroyed refinery. Crystal looks defeated and overwhelmed as a police siren wails in the distance.
