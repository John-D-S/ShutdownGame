NARRATOR: The flickering sun casts an unsettling strobe effect across Southpoint's already chaotic cityscape.  Crystal, mid-tune on a synth rigged to a repurposed mining drone, feels the usual thrill of the performance fading, replaced by a prickle of unease.  The energy dips, the bass line cuts out.  This isn't just a power glitch.
