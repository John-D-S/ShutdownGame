NARRATOR: The artificial sun sputters, casting long, eerie shadows across Southpoint.  Another blackout looms, and the usual frantic energy of the city feels… strained. Crystal, perched on a crumbling rooftop, fiddles with her synth, the rhythmic pulse a defiant counterpoint to the looming darkness.  She needs a distraction, a rush, something to make this terrifying reality fade.

    NARRATOR: Crystal's electrifying performance, laced with subliminal messages revealing Helios's crimes, overwhelms the party-goers.  Chaos erupts, drawing the attention of authorities, but also exposing Helios’s illegal activities to the public. The ensuing investigation temporarily halts their exotope theft.

    NARRATOR: Helios's security detail is tighter than anticipated. Crystal's performance, while impressive, is overshadowed by a sudden, brutal crackdown on the party. Her sonic weapon malfunctions, causing only a minor disruption, and she's forced to flee, the exposure failing to materialize.
