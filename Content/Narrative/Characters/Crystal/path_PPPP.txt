NARRATOR: The artificial sun sputters, casting long, flickering shadows across Southpoint.  Another blackout looms, but Crystal, buzzing with nervous energy, sees an opportunity.  The Helios corporation, responsible for the exotope mess, is hosting a lavish "Sun's Last Stand" party â€“ a grotesque celebration of impending doom.

Using a custom-built sonic device disguised as a synth, she subtly hacks into Helios's mainframe, releasing damning evidence of their sabotage and corrupt practices. The ensuing chaos distracts authorities long enough for her to escape.
