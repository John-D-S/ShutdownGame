NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly yellow smear in the bruised sky, casts long shadows across the ravaged remains of Southpoint's rig district.  Dust motes dance in the weak light, illuminating the wreckage of Crystal's ill-fated rave – a testament to her desperate attempt to outrun the encroaching dread.  The air hangs heavy with the scent of burnt exotope and despair.  Crystal sits amidst the debris, her augmented instruments twisted and broken like so many shattered dreams.  The vibrant, chaotic energy that once fueled her is gone, replaced by a hollow ache.  The data chip, the leaked Helios memos, lie forgotten, another failed attempt to confront the reality she so diligently avoided.

CRYSTAL: (whispering, her voice hoarse)  They… they actually did it.  The sun’s… on.  Stupid, isn’t it?  All that… chaos… for nothing.  Another… near miss.  Another party… over.  Should've… should've done something… *real*.  But… where’s the fun in that?

# IMAGE: Crystal, alone amidst the ruins of the rave, her face streaked with grime and tears, clutching a broken synth-string.  The artificial sun casts a feeble glow on her defeated posture. The wreckage of the rave stretches around her, broken equipment and abandoned neon lights scattered amidst the dust.

NARRATOR:  The news feeds flicker with fragmented reports – Shae, Trent, Dax.  Names she barely registers. Their successes, their sacrifices… irrelevant to her failure.  The exotope supply remains compromised, a fragile lifeline holding the sun’s precarious existence together. Crystal feels the familiar pang of anxiety, but this time, the numbness is deeper, more pervasive.  The thrill is gone, replaced by the crushing weight of consequences.  The escape she so desperately craved has become her prison.  There's no next party, no next gig, no next rush. Only the lingering taste of ash and regret.

CRYSTAL: (to herself, a bitter laugh escaping her lips)  So this is it then… the ultimate show.  A solo performance for an audience of one.  And the encore?  There isn't one.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Crystal's hand, trembling as she touches a shard of broken glass from a shattered exotope canister, the faint glow mirroring the failing sun. Her face is obscured by shadow, her eyes hollow.
