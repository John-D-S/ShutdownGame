NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale imitation of its former glory, casts a weak, yellowish light across Southpoint. Seven days. Seven days the city teetered on the brink, and seven days Crystal chased the adrenaline, the next thrill, the next escape.  The bass thrum of her latest impromptu gig still vibrates in her bones, a fading echo of the defiant energy she poured into her protest against Helios.  But the victory feels… hollow.

CRYSTAL: (Leaning against a crumbling wall of a Rig District building, fiddling with a damaged synth)  So, the sun's still on.  Great. Another near-miss. Another party averted.  But honestly?  I’m exhausted.  And a little… bored.  (A wry smile plays on her lips)  They actually listened, a little.  Helios backed off, slightly.  Enough to keep the automatons from, you know, *actually* shutting down the whole damn planet.  For now.

NARRATOR: The data streams on her augmented visor display a graph showing a slight, almost imperceptible uptick in exotope delivery to Sun Island.  The overall situation is still precarious; Helios still holds most of the power, and Crystal's actions only bought a little more time.  Her usual restless energy is replaced by a weary stillness.

CRYSTAL: (Sighs, then pulls out a data chip)  Maybe... maybe dwelling on the problem isn't such a waste of time after all.  This data... this is more than just a gig. It’s the start of something. Something bigger than a party.

NARRATOR: The data chip contains a meticulously compiled collection of evidence – all the incriminating memos, the leaked reports, the recordings from her protest.  It is a record of Helios’s corruption, a weapon she intends to use, eventually. Eventually...

# IMAGE: Crystal, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, looking out over a chaotic but slightly less desperate Southpoint. Her expression is not entirely defeated, but one of quiet resolve, the weight of responsibility just beginning to dawn.  She's looking at a data stream on her visor, but it seems less chaotic and more focused than before.


# IMAGE: Close up on the data chip in Crystal's hand, displaying holographic projections of key incriminating documents.  The background subtly shows the weak sun casting long shadows across the city.


NARRATOR: The thrill is gone, but a quiet determination, a newfound resolve, takes its place.  She’s still Crystal, still chasing experiences – but now, those experiences are less about fleeting distractions and more about making a real, lasting change.  The fight against Helios is far from over; the sun still shines precariously, but for the first time, Crystal is not running away from the problem. She's preparing to face it.
