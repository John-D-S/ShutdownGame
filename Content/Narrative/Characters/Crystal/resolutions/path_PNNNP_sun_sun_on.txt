NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly yellow orb in the bruised sky, hangs precariously above Southpoint.  Seven days. Seven days of near-apocalypse averted, not by any grand plan of Crystal's, but by a messy, chaotic confluence of near-misses.  The Helios extraction rigs stand silent, monuments to both her limited success and the city's stubborn refusal to fully crumble.  The air still hums with the fading echoes of her defiant concert, a testament to the raw energy she unleashed, but also to its ultimately incomplete effect.

CRYSTAL: (Leaning against a battered synth, a faint smile playing on her lips)  So, the sun's still up.  Who'd have thought? Another close one, huh?  Guess my little rave-riot actually *did* something.  Scored a few points against Helios, at least enough to buy them some time… or maybe just enough to make them nervous.  Enough for now, I guess.  (She takes a long drag from a synth-ale can.)

# IMAGE: Crystal silhouetted against the setting (but still functional) artificial sun, a weary but not entirely defeated look on her face.  The remains of her makeshift stage are strewn around her, along with discarded instruments and flyers for her impromptu "Sun's Gonna Set" rave. In the background, the partly damaged Helios extraction rigs stand like broken teeth against the skyline.


NARRATOR:  The systemic problems remain, festering beneath the surface.  Helios is bruised, but not broken. Her own avoidance tendencies, that compulsive need for the next thrill, the next distraction, haven't vanished.  The anxiety, the underlying fear she’s always chased away, still lurks. But today, it’s a dull ache rather than a sharp stab of panic.  There's a glimmer of something else, too – a fragile understanding that even fleeting moments of connection, of defiance, can have unforeseen consequences, unexpected weight.  

CRYSTAL: (To herself, more than anyone else)  Okay, next gig.  Gotta find the next gig.  But… maybe I’ll try to…  finish a song this time.  Yeah. Finish a song.   And maybe, just maybe, call Liam.   He actually answered my last message.  

# IMAGE: Crystal, staring at a holographic projection of a partially finished song on her synth, a look of quiet contemplation replacing her usual restless energy. The faint glow of the artificial sun casts a warm light on her face.

NARRATOR: The sun remains, for now. But the fragility of its existence, and the fragility of her own carefully constructed world, is etched into the cityscape and her own soul, a sobering reminder of the price of escapism and the quiet strength found in unexpected, incomplete victories.
