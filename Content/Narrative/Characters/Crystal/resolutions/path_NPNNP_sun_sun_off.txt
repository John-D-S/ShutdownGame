NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dying ember in the inky black sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the deserted Southpoint rigs.  Crystal, perched atop a crumbling Helios building, felt the chill wind bite through her synth-silk jacket.  The city, once a kaleidoscope of neon and pulsating bass, was a silent monument to its own hubris.  Her hacking had exposed Helios, yes, but the damage was done. The exotope supply lines, already crippled, were now completely severed.

CRYSTAL: (To herself, a low chuckle escaping her lips)  Well, that was… eventful.  A spectacular crash and burn, even if it wasn't quite the *grand finale* I'd envisioned.  Helios is down, but Ita… Ita's in the dark.  Shoulda, coulda, woulda… been more… *strategic*?  Nah. That's not my style.

# IMAGE: Crystal silhouetted against the dying light of the setting planets, the city of Southpoint below bathed in the darkness, her augmented instruments discarded beside her. A faint, almost imperceptible glow emanates from a damaged Helios data terminal behind her.

NARRATOR:  The weight of the situation pressed down on her, a heavy blanket of silence replacing the usual frantic energy. The thrill of the chase, the high of the heist, the adrenaline of the expose – it was all gone, replaced by a hollow ache.  Her fleeting victories felt insignificant against the backdrop of planetary failure.  She'd managed to disrupt the system, but not to save it. The city’s fate, and her own, hung precariously in the balance, a harsh counterpoint to her lifelong belief that there was always something better just around the corner. There wasn't.  Not this time.

CRYSTAL: (Muttering, more to herself than to anyone else) Maybe...maybe there's a party on another planet?  Gotta find a way to get there. There always has to be *something*.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Crystal’s face; a mixture of defiance, exhaustion, and a flicker of her familiar, restless energy still present in her eyes.  She stares into the approaching darkness with an expression that suggests an unsettling combination of acceptance and determined evasion.  The glow of a discarded data chip reflects faintly in her eyes.
