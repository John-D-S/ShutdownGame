NARRATOR: Seven days. Seven days of chaos, of near-catastrophic failure, and against all odds, a flickering, sputtering victory.  The artificial sun, a pale imitation of its former glory, still burns.  Crystal, perched on the rooftop of her sparsely furnished apartment, watches the weak light paint the Southpoint skyline in hues of bruised orange and sickly yellow.  The air hums with a nervous energy, a fragile peace hanging precariously over a city still teetering on the brink.

CRYSTAL: (To herself, a low hum of satisfaction mixed with underlying anxiety)  So, the sun's on.  Barely.  Thanks to me, mostly.  And a few other… *convenient* coincidences.  Who knew a city-wide rave could topple a corporate empire?  But still… it's not exactly… *sustainable*, is it?

# IMAGE: Crystal, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, a half-empty bottle of something sparkling beside her. Her augmented instruments are scattered around her, a mix of sleek new tech and jury-rigged repurposed components.  The city below is a hazy mix of celebration and uncertainty.

NARRATOR: The victory, while sweet, tastes faintly of ash.  The systemic issues that nearly extinguished Ita remain; the fragile truce bought with a hastily orchestrated rebellion is a temporary fix at best.  Helios is wounded, not broken.  The deep-seated corruption, the ingrained apathy—it all persists.  Yet, a seed of change has been planted.  A spark of collective action, ignited not by fear, but by the electrifying energy of a performance.

CRYSTAL: (Grinning, a touch nervously)  Guess I'm not so good at long-term commitments, but I'm surprisingly decent at spontaneous revolutions.  Next gig?  Maybe a benefit concert for sun-grade exotope research?  Or perhaps, a slightly less chaotic, definitely less life-threatening revolution?  One step at a time, right?  It's not like I can run forever.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Crystal's face, her usual vibrant energy tempered by a newfound quiet intensity. A hint of exhaustion in her eyes, yet also a flicker of hope.  The weak sunlight catches a newly-visible scar on her arm, a memento of the rebellion.

NARRATOR: The thrill of the chase remains, but the void it once filled is slowly being replaced with something else – a sense of responsibility, a quiet determination to continue fighting, not just for her own survival, but for the survival of a planet she’s begun to call home.  The escape is over; the real work begins.
