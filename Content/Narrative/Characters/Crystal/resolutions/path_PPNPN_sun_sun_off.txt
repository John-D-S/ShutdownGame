NARRATOR: The final embers of Ita's artificial sun are fading, casting long, skeletal shadows across the ravaged landscape of Southpoint.  The air hangs heavy with the stench of burnt exotope and the chilling silence of a city plunged into darkness.  Crystal, perched atop a collapsed Helios extraction rig, clutches a battered synth, its circuits sparking erratically.  The thrill is gone, replaced by a gnawing emptiness.  Her flamboyant attire is torn and dirty, a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos she once embraced.

CRYSTAL: (To herself, a whisper lost in the encroaching night)  Should have… should have pushed harder.  More… more *something*.  But another party? Another gig?  What good would that have done?  The data was there.  I showed them.  But... it wasn't enough.  Damn Helios, damn ColCorp, damn everyone who let this happen.

# IMAGE: Crystal, silhouetted against the fading light, her face etched with a mixture of exhaustion and regret.  The broken remains of Southpoint stretch out behind her, a testament to the collective failure.  The faint glow of scattered emergency lights offers little solace.

NARRATOR:  The whispers of the crowd that once fueled her, the energy that drove her relentless pursuit of the next high, are silenced. The realization of her complicity – in ignoring the warning signs, prioritizing fleeting thrills over real change – hangs heavy.  Her stated belief, that dwelling on negativity is a waste of time, feels like a cruel joke now that the time for escapism has run out. The weight of inaction, of partially successful attempts that ultimately fell short, settles on her.  The fear she'd always outrun is no longer a distant threat but a suffocating reality.

CRYSTAL: (A harsh laugh escapes her lips)  So this is it, huh? The ultimate blackout.  The grand finale.  Guess there's no encore this time.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Crystal's hands, still clutching the damaged synth, her fingers tracing the cracked surface.  Her eyes reflect the dying light, a flicker of defiance still burning within the depths of her despair.  The broken remains of her equipment and the desolate cityscape are visible in the background.

NARRATOR: The silence of the dying sun is broken only by the low hum of the automatons, their movements now more assertive, their mission – the preservation of Ita – more urgent than ever.  The party’s over.  And Crystal, for the first time in her life, is facing the music.
