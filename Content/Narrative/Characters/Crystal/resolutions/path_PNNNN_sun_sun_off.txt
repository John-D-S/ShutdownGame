NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a bruised orange smear on the horizon, finally winked out.  Silence, thick and suffocating, descended on Southpoint.  Crystal, huddled in the wreckage of her abandoned studio, a skeletal frame against the encroaching darkness, felt a hollow ache replace the familiar thrill of chaos.  The bass throb of her last, desperate performance – a defiant scream against Helios and the dying light – echoed only in the emptiness.  Her augmented visor flickered, displaying a grim newsfeed: the exotope supply, compromised by Helios's negligence and her own failures, was irrevocably depleted.  The automatons, their patience exhausted, had initiated emergency protocols, leaving the fate of Ita uncertain.


CRYSTAL: (Whispering, more to herself than anyone else)  Should’ve… should’ve done something *real*.  Not another damn rave… another distraction.  Damn it all.  This wasn’t… supposed to happen.  There was *always* another gig, another escape… another… something.


NARRATOR:  The data chip, the leaked memos, the fleeting moments of clarity – all reduced to meaningless fragments in the face of utter defeat.  The vibrant chaos of Southpoint had been swallowed by a darkness deeper and colder than anything she'd ever known.  Her compulsion, her constant need for stimulation, had blinded her to the looming threat, her stated belief – that there was always something better just around the corner – had become a cruel irony.  The weight of her inaction crushed her, the hollow anxiety she’d spent her life outrunning finally catching up.  Escape was no longer an option; only the bitter taste of regret remained.


# IMAGE: Crystal sits amidst the ruins of her studio, her face illuminated only by the faint glow of her augmented visor, which displays a news feed detailing the city’s bleak future.  The empty exotope canisters litter the floor around her, discarded remnants of her futile attempts to control the uncontrollable. The absence of the artificial sun casts an oppressive shadow across the scene.


# IMAGE: A long shot of Southpoint at night, completely dark save for the sporadic flickers of emergency power, the towering Helios extraction rigs silhouetted against the star-filled sky; a chilling image of a world consumed by its own apathy.  The scene emphasizes the vastness of the desolation and the crushing weight of collective failure.
