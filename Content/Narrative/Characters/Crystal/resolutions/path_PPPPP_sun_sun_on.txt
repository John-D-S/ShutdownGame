NARRATOR: Seven days. Seven days of chaos, of near-apocalyptic dread, and – surprisingly – of exhilarating, almost manic, activity.  The artificial sun, a sputtering behemoth, still hangs in the sky, a testament to a fragile, hard-won victory.  Crystal, perched on the rooftop of a reclaimed Helios building, surveys the city below. The air hums with a strange, uneasy calm. The usual Southpoint buzz is muted, replaced by a collective sigh of relief, tinged with the lingering aftertaste of fear.

CRYSTAL: (To herself, a low chuckle escaping her lips)  So, the world didn't end. Who'd have thought?  Not even my most epic party could top this kind of adrenaline rush.  Honestly, exposing Helios was way more satisfying than any gig I've ever played.  Way more meaningful.  

# IMAGE: Crystal silhouetted against the setting sun, her augmented instruments resting beside her. The city sprawls beneath her, a tapestry of lights and shadows.  A faint, almost imperceptible smile plays on her lips.

NARRATOR:  The revelation of Helios's sabotage, a wildfire ignited by her audacious hack, had sparked a wave of change.  Southpoint, once dominated by the corporation's iron fist, now pulsed with the energy of a newly awakened populace.  The flow of pure exotopes, secured by her actions, had bought Ita precious time, but the system's underlying fragility remained. The sun might be on, but the underlying cracks were still there. The weight of this realisation hits her, a cold wave amidst the celebratory heat.

CRYSTAL: (Eyes distant, a flicker of anxiety in her gaze)  But… it's just a reprieve, right? A patch, a band-aid on a gaping wound.  One more party before the real reckoning?  Maybe…maybe I'll finally start finishing those projects.  One step at a time. 

# IMAGE: Close-up on Crystal's face, a mixture of exhilaration and quiet contemplation in her eyes. The faint glow of the artificial sun reflects in her augmented visor.

NARRATOR: The usual restless energy that fueled her impulsive choices, her frantic pursuit of the next thrill, is different now.  A quiet determination, a newly discovered sense of responsibility, had replaced the anxiety-driven escapism.  The challenge wasn't over; far from it. But for the first time, Crystal didn't feel the paralyzing fear of the unknown. She faced it head-on, armed with a newfound sense of purpose and the knowledge that sometimes, the biggest rush came not from fleeting pleasures, but from facing down your demons and building something real.
