NARRATOR: The artificial sun is a dead ember in the inky sky, casting long, skeletal shadows across the ravaged landscape of Southpoint.  The air hangs heavy with the stench of burnt exotope and despair.  Crystal sits amidst the wreckage of her last, ill-fated rave – a chaotic mess of twisted metal, shattered equipment, and flickering emergency lights.  Her vibrant, once-flamboyant outfit is torn and stained, a stark contrast to the bleak surroundings.  The data chip, containing evidence of Helios’s crimes, lies forgotten in the dust.

CRYSTAL: (Whispering, more to herself than anyone else)  Should have… should have done something… *something* different.  A better rave?  A bigger leak?  Something…  Anything… to… (she trails off, a hollow laugh escaping her lips).  Another gig.  Always another gig just around the corner.  Right?

NARRATOR:  The weight of her failure crushes her.  The thrill is gone, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. Her usual optimism is a brittle façade, barely concealing the overwhelming anxiety she’s spent her life running from. The chaos she craved has arrived, but it's not the exhilarating chaos of a successful rave; it's the crushing weight of a world collapsing around her.  The city's once vibrant energy is extinguished, replaced by a desperate scramble for survival.  Her attempts to manipulate the situation, to use the crisis as fuel for her art, backfired spectacularly, leaving her stranded in the aftermath of her own self-destructive escapism.  The faint glow of a discarded holo-screen shows newsfeeds reporting on the complete failure of the sun, a culmination of corporate greed and individual apathy.

# IMAGE: Crystal huddled amidst the ruins of the Helios refinery, her face illuminated by the sickly green glow of a damaged emergency light.  The dead artificial sun hangs like a dark omen in the sky above, the city around her plunged into a chilling darkness.

CRYSTAL: (Muttering, her voice barely audible)  Maybe… maybe there’s a party on… another planet…

NARRATOR:  The thought, usually a source of excitement, offers no comfort.  The reality of her situation, the consequences of her avoidance, settle upon her like a suffocating blanket.  There's no escape this time.  The music has died.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Southpoint at night, shrouded in darkness.  The only light sources are scattered emergency lights and the flickering screens of desperate citizens.  Crystal is a tiny, insignificant figure amidst the overwhelming desolation.
