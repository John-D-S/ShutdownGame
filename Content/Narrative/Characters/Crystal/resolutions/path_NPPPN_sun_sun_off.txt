NARRATOR: The final sunset bleeds across the sky, a bruised purple fading into an inky black.  The artificial sun, Ita's failing heart, is finally silent.  Crystal stands on the rooftop of a crumbling Helios building, the city below a chaotic tapestry of flickering emergency lights and desperate shouts.  The air is thick with the smell of ozone and fear.  She clutches a half-empty bottle of synth-ale, its glow reflecting in her wide, apprehensive eyes.  Her flamboyant clothing, once a symbol of defiant joy, now feels like a costume in this stark reality.  The silence, broken only by the distant wail of sirens, is deafening.

CRYSTAL: (to herself, a nervous laugh escaping her lips)  Well, *that* was… unexpected.  A bit less "epic rave," more "apocalyptic blackout."  Should've booked a backup gig, right?  Always have a Plan B... or C... or…

NARRATOR:  The data chip, the half-exposed truth about Helios's corruption, remains untouched in her pocket.  Her attempt to awaken Southpoint, to use her music as a weapon against apathy, had been a small spark in a wildfire of systemic failure.  The city, crippled by a confluence of corporate greed and political maneuvering, had been too easily distracted; she, in turn, too easily distracted from the real threat by the urgency of the next thrill.  The partial success she’d achieved – the small crack in Helios's facade – feels insignificant now, swallowed by the overwhelming darkness.

CRYSTAL: (muttering, her voice laced with a hint of panic) Okay, okay, think. New plan.  There's gotta be *something*.  A hidden generator… a secret underground bunker… a spaceship fueled by pure, unadulterated rave energy…

NARRATOR:  She scans the horizon, the darkness swallowing the city.  The familiar pull of escape battles with a nascent, unfamiliar feeling – a cold dread that borders on acceptance.  The thrill-seeking escape is gone, replaced by a raw, chilling uncertainty. The weight of collective failure, of her own complicity in the systemic failings, settles heavily on her shoulders.

# IMAGE: Crystal silhouetted against the starless sky, a single tear tracing a path through the shimmering synth-ale on her cheek. The city below is a sprawling, dark mass, punctuated only by the sporadic flicker of emergency lights.

CRYSTAL: (whispering, her voice barely audible above the wind)  Maybe… maybe there isn't always something better just around the corner.  Maybe… dwelling on it isn't a waste of time after all.


# IMAGE: A close-up on Crystal's hand, still clutching the half-empty bottle of synth-ale, her knuckles white as she clenches the data chip in her fist. The faint, almost imperceptible glow of the chip offers a small, flickering hope against the absolute darkness of the planet.
