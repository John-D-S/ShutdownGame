NARRATOR: Dawn breaks, painting the Southpoint rigs in hues of bruised purple and sickly orange.  The artificial sun, a sputtering behemoth, still hangs in the sky, a testament to the precarious balance achieved by the combined, haphazard efforts of the city-states.  Crystal, perched on a rusted catwalk overlooking the now-silent rig district, sips lukewarm synth-ale.  The remnants of last night's chaotic rave – a testament to her defiant, partially successful attempt to expose Helios's corruption – litter the landscape below.

CRYSTAL: (To herself, a wry smile playing on her lips)  So, the world didn't end.  That's… anticlimactic, isn’t it?  Though, honestly, a bit relieved.  Less cleanup. More gigs.

NARRATOR:  The data chip, the leaked memos, they made a ripple.  Helios is reeling, their reputation tarnished, but not broken. The system’s still rigged, just… slightly less so.  The executive she'd impressed at the rave?  He's offering a 'partnership'—a series of exclusive, high-paying gigs that would keep her afloat for a while.  The usual fleeting, shallow connections, but with a slightly higher payout this time.

CRYSTAL: (Scoffs, then shrugs)  It's a gig, right?  Better than scavenging for scrap. Besides, there's always another party, another sound, another city.   The sun's still up, that's something.  For now.

# IMAGE: Crystal silhouetted against the weak sunlight, a half-empty synth-ale can in her hand, gazing over the sprawling, damaged rig district. A sleek, high-tech musical instrument case rests at her feet.

NARRATOR:  The underlying anxiety remains, a low hum beneath the surface of her manic energy.  The systemic issues she'd tried to tackle still fester, a constant, low-level threat. But for now, the immediate crisis is averted.  The thrill of survival, of having evaded catastrophe – even without making lasting change – is enough to momentarily quell the creeping dread.  The next rush is already forming on the horizon.  A new city, a new sound, a new gig – something to keep her moving.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Crystal's face, a mixture of exhaustion and cautious optimism in her eyes, a flicker of underlying anxiety barely concealed behind her usual upbeat facade. The flickering sunlight catches the gleam of a newly acquired augmentation on her wrist.
