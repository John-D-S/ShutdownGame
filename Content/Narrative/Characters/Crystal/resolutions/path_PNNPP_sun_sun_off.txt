NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dying ember in the inky black sky, casts long, skeletal shadows across the ravaged landscape of Southpoint.  Seven days. Seven days of frantic parties, near-misses, and a rebellion that ultimately fell short.  The air hangs heavy with the silence that follows a failed crescendo. Crystal sits atop a crumbling Helios refinery, her augmented instruments scattered around her like fallen trophies.  The echoing silence is broken only by the rhythmic hiss of escaping exotope – a stark reminder of Helios's negligence and the planet's precarious state.  Her usually vibrant clothing is torn and dirty, but her eyes, though tired, hold a strange new clarity.

CRYSTAL: (to herself, a low murmur)  So, this is it, huh?  The big finale. No encore.  Thought I could party my way out of this one, keep the beat going until the lights came back on.  Guess I was wrong.  But… (a flicker of a smile plays on her lips) …at least I made *some* noise.  

# IMAGE: Crystal sits silhouetted against the dying light of Ita's sun, her face etched with weariness but also a newfound resolve.  The wreckage of the Helios refinery and the desolate cityscape stretch out behind her, a testament to both failure and unexpected success.  A single, defiant synth note echoes faintly from a damaged instrument at her feet.


NARRATOR: The rebellion, fueled by her impulsive actions and the raw energy of her music, exposed Helios’s corruption.  The flow of pure exotope did increase, temporarily. But it wasn't enough.  The systemic failures, the political maneuvering, the disinformation – it all crashed down like a collapsing waveform.  The sun's off, and there's no immediate fix.  Yet, in the wreckage, something has shifted within Crystal.  The thrill of the chase has been replaced by a quiet, almost unsettling calm.  The fear still lingers, a low hum beneath the surface, but now it's accompanied by a strange, unfamiliar weight: responsibility.

CRYSTAL: (A sigh escapes her lips, a sound more weary than defeated)  Guess there’s no more running.  No more chasing the next high. The next gig.  The next… escape.  Maybe facing the music – the *real* music – is better than drowning it out.  Maybe it’s time to build something… lasting. Even if it's just a new kind of party. A whole new kind of… revolution.

# IMAGE:  A close-up of Crystal's hands, gently touching a damaged synth, her expression thoughtful and determined.  In the background, a small group of other survivors gathers, drawn by the faint music emanating from her instrument.  The darkness is absolute, but a spark of resilience flickers in their eyes.
