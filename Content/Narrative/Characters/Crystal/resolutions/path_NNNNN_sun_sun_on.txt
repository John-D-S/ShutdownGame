NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly yellow eye in the bruised sky, hangs precariously.  Southpoint, usually a riot of neon, is subdued, the air thick with the scent of burnt exotope and simmering resentment. Crystal sits alone on the rooftop of a derelict rig, a half-empty bottle of synth-ale clutched in her hand.  Her usual flamboyant attire is replaced by something drab and utilitarian, a stark reflection of the exhaustion etched on her face.  The aftermath of her botched attempt to contact the automatons – a chaotic mess of malfunctioning tech and Helios security – is a bitter reminder of her failure.

CRYSTAL: (Muttering to herself, voice raspy)  Should've… should've just…  gone to that damn party.  More data… more… *something*. Anything but this.  

NARRATOR: The newsfeeds, flickering intermittently, show snippets of Shae's victory, Trent's hard-won success, and Dax's belated exposé.  The sun's still on, a fragile victory bought with the blood, sweat, and near-misses of others.  Crystal feels a pang of something akin to guilt – a fleeting emotion quickly smothered by a wave of self-preservation.

CRYSTAL: (Scoffs)  See?  Told you it'd all work out.  Close call, yeah, but…  we're still here.  Another party… another gig…  gotta find the next high.  Before… you know…

NARRATOR:  She downs the rest of the synth-ale, the metallic tang doing little to soothe the emptiness inside.  The sun's survival feels less like a triumph and more like a reprieve, a temporary stay of execution. The city below is a tapestry of exhaustion and simmering unrest; a testament to the systemic failures she chose to ignore.  Her music, her talent, her vibrant energy – all squandered on fleeting thrills, leaving her stranded in the bleak aftermath of her own avoidance.  The next high feels distant, the next escape even more elusive.

# IMAGE: Crystal silhouetted against the flickering artificial sun, her back to the chaotic city below, a single tear tracing a path through the grime on her cheek.  Her hand rests listlessly on a discarded, damaged sonic weapon.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Crystal’s hand, calloused and stained with exotope residue, nervously fiddling with a damaged data chip—a small, tangible reminder of the information she failed to act upon. The chip is cracked and partially destroyed.
