NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dying ember in the inky black, cast long, skeletal shadows across the desolate landscape of Southpoint.  The air hung heavy with the stench of burnt exotope and despair.  Crystal, her once vibrant attire now dull and tattered, huddled in a ruined alleyway, the faint rhythm of a broken synth a melancholic counterpoint to the city’s silence.  The frantic energy that once defined her was replaced by a hollow exhaustion.  The final, devastating blackout had plunged Southpoint into chaos, a chaos she had done little to prevent.

CRYSTAL: (Whispering, more to herself than anyone else)  Shoulda… shoulda done something…  But there was always another gig, another rush…  Always something *better* just around the corner.  (A bitter laugh escapes her lips)  Ha.  Funny, isn’t it?  The corner’s always around, but now there’s… nothing.

# IMAGE: Crystal, huddled amongst the rubble of a collapsed building in Southpoint, her face gaunt and drawn, clutching a broken synth.  The sky is a deep, star-studded black, the absence of the artificial sun stark and chilling.

NARRATOR: The leaked Helios memos, the failed attempts to expose their corruption, the missed opportunities – they all swam in her memory, a nauseating kaleidoscope of what-ifs and could-have-beens.  The automatons' warnings, dismissed as mere inconvenient background noise, echoed in the silence, a grim testament to her avoidance and her failure to confront the truth.  Southpoint, the city of lights and endless possibilities, was now a graveyard of broken dreams, a monument to her own self-destructive escapism.  The final, crushing weight of responsibility settled upon her shoulders, far too heavy for the thrill-seeking musician who had always run from the shadows.

CRYSTAL: (A choked sob)  It’s… it’s dark.  So dark.  And… it’s all my fault.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Crystal's face, tears freezing on her cheeks in the frigid night air, reflecting the bleak, starlit sky.  The faint glow of her broken synth is barely visible.

NARRATOR:  The weight of a dying world rested on her shoulders, a chilling counterpoint to the exhilarating highs she had always chased.  The vibrant chaos of Southpoint had been silenced, not by a grand catastrophe, but by a thousand small failures, each a testament to her own desperate need to escape the pain and anxiety she had so long avoided.  The final, bitter irony was that, in escaping the crisis, she had ultimately become its victim.
