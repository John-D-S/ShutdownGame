NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale, wavering disc in the hazy sky, cast long shadows across the ravaged landscape of Southpoint's rig district.  The air hummed with a low, unsettling thrum – a mixture of residual energy from Crystal's last defiant performance and the collective anxiety of a city clinging to life by a thread.  Seven days. Seven days of chaos, near misses, and fleeting victories.  The sun was still burning, a fragile testament to the combined, haphazard efforts of strangers across a fractured planet.  But the victory felt… hollow.

CRYSTAL: (Leaning against a twisted metal beam, her once vibrant clothing now torn and stained, a faint smile playing on her lips)  Well, that was… something.  A hell of a light show, even if it didn't quite topple Helios.  At least I got a few good tracks out of it, right?  Enough to drown out the… existential dread for a while.  

# IMAGE: Crystal, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, her face a mixture of exhaustion and reluctant acceptance.  Around her lies the debris of her failed protest – mangled sonic weaponry, scattered flyers, and the remnants of a once-vibrant performance.  The artificial sun hangs precariously in the sky, a pale imitation of its former glory.

NARRATOR:  She’d exposed some of Helios’s corruption, stirred up enough dust to make them uncomfortable.  But the systemic rot remained.  Southpoint still choked under their grip, and the fragility of Ita’s sun, a constant reminder of the consequences of fragmented efforts and her own ingrained avoidance. The fleeting thrill of rebellion had faded, leaving behind a gnawing emptiness. Her stated belief – that life was meant to be a relentless pursuit of the next high – felt hollow, a flimsy shield against the stark reality of near-catastrophe.  The adrenaline rush of almost-success had left her more vulnerable to the underlying anxiety she'd always tried to outrun.

CRYSTAL: (To herself, almost a whisper)  Maybe tomorrow… tomorrow I’ll figure out a way to fix the damn things. Or at least find a better party.  


# IMAGE: A close-up shot of Crystal's hand, resting on a damaged sonic weapon. Her fingers trace a crack in the metal, a reflection of the cracks in her own carefully constructed facade. The faintest glimmer of resolve flickers in her eyes.
