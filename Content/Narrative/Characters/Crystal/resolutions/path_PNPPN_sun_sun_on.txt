NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a pale imitation of its former glory, hangs low in the sky.  Seven days. Seven days of near-catastrophe narrowly averted.  Crystal stands on the rooftop of a half-destroyed building in Southpoint, the remnants of her last ill-fated attempt to take down Helios scattered around her.  The city below is a patchwork of vibrant chaos and simmering unease; the victory over Helios felt hollow, temporary.

CRYSTAL: (Scoffs, fiddling with a damaged synth module)  So, the sun's still on.  Big whoop.  Didn't exactly stop Helios from leaving a trail of broken promises and even more broken equipment in its wake. Another near-miss, another close call – this whole planet runs on borrowed time.  

# IMAGE: Crystal, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, surveys the damaged cityscape of Southpoint. Her expression is a mixture of exhaustion and defiance, a faint flicker of anxiety underlying the bravado.  Damaged synth parts litter the rooftop around her.

NARRATOR:  The truth, a bitter pill even for Crystal's relentlessly optimistic nature, dawns slowly. Her actions created ripples, exposing some of Helios's corruption, but the systemic rot remained. The combined efforts of others, not her own single-minded crusade, were what kept the sun burning.  The thrill of the chase, the adrenaline of the near-misses – it all pales against the quiet, terrifying certainty that this was only a temporary reprieve.  The escape continues, but the shadow of responsibility, long avoided, looms larger than ever.

CRYSTAL: (Muttering to herself, a glint of determination in her eyes) Okay, fine.  New plan.  Bigger stage.  This isn't over.  Not even close. But next time, maybe I'll actually finish the job.

# IMAGE: Crystal, silhouetted against the weak sunlight, picks up her damaged synth, a determined glint in her eye. A faint, hopeful melody begins to emerge from the damaged instrument.  The city stretches out behind her, a chaotic but strangely resilient landscape.
