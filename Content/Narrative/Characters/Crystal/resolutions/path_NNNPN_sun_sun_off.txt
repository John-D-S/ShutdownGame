NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dying ember in the inky black sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the ravaged landscape of Southpoint.  The air hung heavy with the stench of burnt exotope and despair.  Crystal, her usually vibrant attire now drab and torn, sat hunched amidst the rubble of what was once her studio, a half-finished track pulsing weakly from a damaged synth.  The city was silent, save for the occasional groan of collapsing structures and the distant wail of sirens.  Her usual frenetic energy was replaced by a hollow emptiness.

CRYSTAL: (Whispering, more to herself than anyone else)  Shoulda… shoulda…  There was *always* another gig, another party… another chance.  Another… exotope hit.  Damn it.  (A bitter laugh escapes her lips)  The best show *ever*…  and no one even saw it.

NARRATOR: The failed attack on Helios’s data center hadn't just backfired; it had exacerbated the already precarious situation. The resulting power surge, combined with the compromised exotope supply, had dealt a fatal blow to the sun's already dwindling reserves.  The leaked memos, the frantic performances, the desperate attempts at distraction—all had amounted to nothing.  Her compulsive need for the next thrill, her avoidance of confronting the harsh reality of the situation, had sealed Ita’s fate.

CRYSTAL: (Stares at the broken synth, her eyes unfocused)  Always something better just around the corner…  Yeah, right.  The corner's gone.  The whole damn world's gone.  (She picks up a shard of broken glass, tracing its jagged edge with a numb finger.)  Guess this is… the ultimate blackout.

# IMAGE: Crystal sits amidst the ruins of Southpoint, the lifeless artificial sun a black void in the sky. Her face is etched with a mixture of exhaustion, regret, and a chilling acceptance.  The broken synth at her feet emits a faint, distorted final note.

NARRATOR:  The weight of her failure pressed down on her, a crushing weight far heavier than any anxiety she had ever known before.  The vibrant, chaotic energy of Southpoint, the thrill of the chase, the escape offered by music – all were gone, swallowed by the cold, unforgiving darkness.  The finality of it all was almost… peaceful. Almost.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Crystal’s hand, clutching the shard of glass. Her eyes are hollow, reflecting the starless sky. A single tear traces a path through the grime on her cheek.  The faint, dying light of a nearby emergency beacon casts a pale, desperate glow.
