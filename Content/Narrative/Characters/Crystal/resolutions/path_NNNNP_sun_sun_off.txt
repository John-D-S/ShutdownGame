NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dark eye in the inky sky, mirrored the emptiness Crystal felt.  Seven days. Seven days of frantic escapes, fleeting triumphs, and ultimately, failure.  The city below was a cacophony of despair, the rhythmic pulse of Southpoint replaced by the ragged breaths of a dying world.  Her ill-fated attempt to reach the automatons, a desperate hail-mary using a half-baked sonic weapon, had backfired spectacularly. Helios, ever vigilant, had snatched the device, the message never sent.  The exotope supply, already compromised by Helios's greed and ColCorp's negligence, remained critically low.

CRYSTAL: (A hollow laugh escapes her lips, the manic energy replaced by a chilling stillness.)  So, this is it, huh? The "best party ever" ends with the lights going out.  Guess there's no encore.  Always something better around the corner, right?  Except… there isn't.  Damn.

# IMAGE: Crystal stands alone on a rooftop overlooking a darkened Southpoint, the city lights flickering weakly. Her usual vibrant attire is replaced by something drab, almost colorless. The expression on her face is a mixture of exhaustion and a chilling acceptance.

NARRATOR: The weight of her inaction, her constant avoidance, crashed down on her. The fear she had always outrun had finally caught up, not as a swift, terrifying chase, but as a suffocating blanket of despair.  The vibrant chaos of Southpoint had fallen silent, a testament to her failure, to the collective failure of a society that prioritized fleeting pleasure over long-term responsibility.

CRYSTAL: (Her voice barely a whisper)  Maybe... maybe there's a party on another planet.  One with a real sun.  Yeah...  that's the plan.  Always a plan.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Crystal’s hand, a single, worn-out flyer clutched in her grip -  the faded image shows a neon-lit cityscape from another planet. A small, almost imperceptible tear traces a path down her cheek. The flyer is the only sign of her unwavering need to seek the next thrill, even in the face of utter defeat.

NARRATOR:  But even the thought of escape held little solace. The crushing weight of reality, the cold silence of the dead sun, was a harsh awakening – a stark counterpoint to the thrilling lie she'd lived by.  The music had stopped, the party was over, and the price of her relentless pursuit of pleasure was a world plunged into darkness.
