NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dying ember in the inky black sky, casts long, skeletal shadows across the deserted streets of Southpoint.  Dust motes dance in the weak, flickering light filtering through the grime-coated windows of Crystal's abandoned apartment.  Empty exotope canisters litter the floor, a testament to her frantic, ultimately futile attempts at escapism.  The rhythmic pulse of her synth, usually a source of vibrant life, is now a mournful dirge.

CRYSTAL: (Whispering, to herself, more a statement than a question)  Another blackout?  Or is it just… fading?  Like… everything else?  (A hollow laugh escapes her lips.)  Should have gone to that after-party… the one with the real intel.  But… nah. Too much commitment.  Another gig. Another high.  Always something better… right?  (Her voice cracks; a tear tracks a path through the grime on her cheek.)

NARRATOR: The data chip, the leaked Helios memos – they'd been nothing more than a fleeting thrill, another fleeting distraction.  Her attempts to warn Southpoint, to leverage her influence, had been haphazard, half-hearted, ultimately unsuccessful. The rave had been a grand finale, not a revolutionary act. The city, plunged into darkness, is a chilling reflection of her own internal landscape – a chaotic mess of missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential.

# IMAGE: Crystal sits alone in her apartment, the faint glow of a dying holographic display illuminating her tear-streaked face.  Empty exotope canisters and discarded musical equipment are scattered around her. The window shows a dark, star-filled sky where the artificial sun used to be.

CRYSTAL: (Her voice rises, a desperate plea to the silent, empty room)  There's always… something better… right?  There has to be… something…

NARRATOR: But the silence is deafening. The darkness is absolute. The only sound is the faint whisper of the wind whistling through the broken panes, carrying the final, fading strains of Crystal's music—a melancholic elegy for a world she had failed to save, and a life she had failed to fully live.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Southpoint at night, utterly dark except for scattered flickering emergency lights, punctuated by the distant glow of fires from desperate citizens scavenging for resources.  The sky is a vast, empty canvas of black, devoid of the artificial sun's light.
