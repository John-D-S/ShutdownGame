NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly orange disc in the bruised sky, hangs precariously.  Seven days. Seven days of near misses, of frantic escapes, of half-formed plans dissolving into the shimmering haze of Southpoint's neon-drenched despair. Crystal sits hunched on the roof of her abandoned apartment, the city a sprawling wasteland below, the air thick with the cloying sweetness of decaying exotope blooms.  Her once vibrant clothes are torn and stained, her usually sparkling eyes dull with exhaustion. The data chip, a useless relic of her failed attempts, lies forgotten beside a half-empty bottle of synth-ale.

CRYSTAL: (Muttering to herself, her voice a raspy whisper)  Should’ve… should’ve gone bigger.  A stadium show.  A global broadcast.  Something… *unforgettable*.  But, hey, at least the sun’s still up, right?  (A bitter laugh escapes her lips.)  Another near miss.  They patched it up.  Again.  But for how long?  Another rave?  Another distraction?  (She kicks a loose piece of metal, sending it tumbling into the abyss below.)  The next gig… yeah, right.  Where’s the gig when the world’s about to end?

# IMAGE: Crystal, silhouetted against the sickly orange glow of the artificial sun, her face obscured by shadows, a single tear tracing a path through the grime on her cheek.  The sprawling, chaotic city of Southpoint stretches out beneath her, a landscape of broken dreams and flickering lights.

NARRATOR: The weight of her failures, the cumulative effect of her relentless flight from responsibility, crushes her. The exhilarating thrill of the chase has faded, leaving behind a bitter residue of anxiety and regret.  The city's survival, hanging by a thread, is a direct reflection of her own inability to confront her fears, her own deeply ingrained compulsion to avoid the pain of facing the truth.  The sun may be on, but the darkness within her has only deepened.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Crystal's hand, clutching a frayed synth-bass cable – a symbol of her broken connection to the music that once served as both her escape and her weapon.  The orange glow of the sun casts long shadows, emphasizing the isolation and despair in the scene.

CRYSTAL: (Whispering, almost to the sun itself)  Maybe tomorrow.  Maybe there'll be another party… another chance… something… better.
