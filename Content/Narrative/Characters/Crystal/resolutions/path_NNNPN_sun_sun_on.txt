NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly yellow orb in the bruised sky, hangs precariously.  Seven days. Seven days of near misses and frantic escapes. Seven days Crystal chased the next high, the next distraction, instead of facing the deepening crisis gnawing at Southpoint's underbelly.  Her ill-fated raid on Helios’ data center backfired spectacularly, plunging the city into deeper darkness, both literally and figuratively.  The exotope supply, already precarious, is now critically depleted.

CRYSTAL: (Slurring slightly, a half-empty flask of cheap exotope clutched in her hand)  See?  Told ya it’d all work out.  Just… a little… bumpy landing.  Shae, Dax, Trent… they saved the damn thing, right?  Good for them.  More power to ‘em.  I… I had my own… uh… *creative* solutions.  (Laughs, a hollow, brittle sound)  Next time, we'll *really* make the sun sing.  A killer gig.  A *massive* light show.

# IMAGE: Crystal sits alone on a rooftop overlooking a dark, chaotic Southpoint, the weak artificial sun barely illuminating the ravaged cityscape.  Empty exotope canisters are scattered around her, a discarded synth lies broken next to her.  Her flamboyant clothing is torn and dirty, a stark contrast to her usual vibrant self.

NARRATOR: The weight of her failure presses down on her, a heavy blanket suffocating the usual frantic energy. The thrill is gone, replaced by a chilling emptiness. The sun remains on, a testament to the efforts of others, a glaring spotlight on her own self-destructive avoidance.  The fleeting highs were never enough to silence the deeper anxiety.  The party’s over.  And the hangover is brutal.

CRYSTAL: (Whispering, more to herself than anyone else)  Maybe… maybe next time… I’ll actually… face the music.

# IMAGE: A close-up on Crystal's face, etched with exhaustion and a flicker of something akin to regret. The artificial sun casts a harsh, unforgiving light on her features, highlighting the stark lines of her face and the dark circles under her eyes.  A single tear traces a path through the grime on her cheek.
