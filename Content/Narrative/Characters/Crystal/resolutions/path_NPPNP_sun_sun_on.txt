NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a hazy, slightly unstable orb in the sky, casts a weak, amber glow across the ravaged landscape of Southpoint.  Seven days. Seven days since the chaos began, seven days since Crystal spearheaded the rebellion against Helios.  The air vibrates with a strange, uneasy quiet – the aftermath of a revolution fought not with weapons, but with sound and leaked data.

CRYSTAL: (Leaning against a half-collapsed Helios rig, a battered synth at her feet, she sips from a flask of something bubbly and brightly colored)  So, the sun's still on.  Barely.  Guess my little sonic tantrum actually did something. Who knew?  Not me, apparently.  I was aiming for a killer rave, not planetary salvation.

# IMAGE: Crystal, bathed in the weak sunlight, smiles wryly.  Her clothing is a mix of tattered festival gear and scavenged tech components, a testament to the chaos she's survived. The wreckage of the Helios refinery stretches behind her, a stark backdrop to the tentative hope in her eyes.

NARRATOR:  The victory is bittersweet. The exotope flows, unevenly, precariously.  The system is far from fixed; the underlying rot remains, a shadow cast by the looming corporations and the deeply fractured city-states. But for the first time in her life, Crystal feels a sense of… grounding. The thrill of the chase hasn't vanished, but it's been tempered with something deeper, a sense of purpose born from facing her fears, not running from them.

CRYSTAL: (A flicker of her old anxiety crosses her face, quickly replaced by a determined grin)  Okay, next challenge.  Rebuilding Southpoint’s music scene, one augmented synth at a time. And maybe, just maybe, figuring out how to get this damn sun to shine a little brighter.  Anyone got a spare exotope canister? This party’s just getting started.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Southpoint, the artificial sun a weak but persistent presence in the sky.  In the foreground, a small group of people gather around Crystal, their faces illuminated by the glow of her synth, a symbol of resilience and the tentative beginnings of a new era.  The wreckage of the past is visible, but a sense of community and rebuilding is palpable.
