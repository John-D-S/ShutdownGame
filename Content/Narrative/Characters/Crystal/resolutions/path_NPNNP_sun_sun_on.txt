NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a weak but persistent ember in the bruised sky, cast a sickly yellow glow across Southpoint. Seven days. Seven days of chaos, of near-misses, of exhilarating escapes and crushing defeats.  Crystal leaned against the crumbling wall of the Helios refinery, the remnants of her last spectacular hack still buzzing faintly in her augmented earpiece.  The air thrummed – not with the frantic energy of a rave, but with a low hum of uneasy calm. Helios was wounded, but not broken.  The exotope flowed, albeit sluggishly, thanks to the efforts of others.  She’d made a dent, caused a disruption, but hadn't toppled the system – or fully conquered her own restless avoidance.

CRYSTAL: (to herself, a wry grin playing on her lips)  So, the world didn't end.  Bummer.  Though, that rave-turned-protest was pretty epic.  And those Helios execs’ faces…priceless.  (She pulls out a data chip, its surface scratched and dented)  Time to move on, find the next thrill, the next challenge.  This city’s too…settled now.  Too predictable.

# IMAGE: Crystal, silhouetted against the setting sun, a battered data chip in her hand.  Behind her, the partially-destroyed Helios refinery stands as a monument to her chaotic rebellion, a testament to both success and failure.  The overall tone is a mix of exhaustion and anticipation, hinting at both her resolve and unresolved anxieties.

NARRATOR:  The news reports crackled about the near-catastrophe averted, praising the unlikely alliance that had saved Ita. Crystal heard whispers of Shae, Trent, Dax – heroes she hadn’t personally encountered but whose efforts had paved the way for her own chaotic brand of rebellion.  A strange sense of… something like satisfaction pricked through her usual restlessness. It wasn't the total victory she craved, but it was enough, for now, to silence the nagging fear that the sun's failure had symbolized.   She needed a break, yeah. But a break from Southpoint, from the aftermath.

CRYSTAL: (Eyes gleaming with a mix of exhaustion and excitement)  Next stop: Seaburn. Heard they've got some crazy new sonic augmentations out there.  And maybe, just maybe, some truly *unpredictable* parties.


# IMAGE:  A close-up of Crystal's face, a faint smile playing on her lips as she stares into the distance, a shimmering holographic projection of a distant city shimmering in her eyes, overlaid by a translucent map showing the route to Seaburn. The map subtly flickers, hinting at her impulsive, ever-changing plans.
