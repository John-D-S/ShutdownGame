NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a sickly yellow orb in the bruised sky, hangs precariously.  Seven days. Seven days of near misses, of frantic escapes and fleeting thrills, all culminating in this – a hollow victory. Crystal sits perched atop a crumbling Helios refinery, a half-empty bottle of synth-ale clutched in her hand, the city sprawling beneath her like a dying organism.  The air vibrates with a low hum, a collective sigh of relief that masks the underlying fragility.

CRYSTAL: (to herself, a brittle laugh escaping her lips)  So, the sun’s still up.  Fantastic.  Just…fantastic.  Another near-death experience, another close call dodged, another… what?  Triumph?  I guess?  (She takes a long swig of the synth-ale.)  But what did *I* actually do?  Another rave, another heist, another… spectacularly meaningless gesture in the face of real catastrophe.  

# IMAGE: Crystal silhouetted against the weak sunlight, her back to the camera, a desolate cityscape spread beneath her.  Empty exotope canisters litter the ground around her feet.

NARRATOR: The news reports crackle through her augmented earpiece – Shae, Trent, Dax… they saved the world. Or at least, the *world* saved itself, despite her.  Helios is crippled, but Southpoint’s exotope supply remains precarious, a ticking time bomb she did nothing to disarm. The thrill is gone.  The adrenaline's faded, replaced by a gnawing emptiness.  

CRYSTAL: (muttering)  Always something better around the corner… right?  (A bitter laugh.)  Except this time, there isn’t.  Just…this.  This bleak, half-lit sunrise.  And me.  Still running.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Crystal’s face, etched with exhaustion and a flicker of something akin to self-awareness.  The artificial sun casts a pale, sickly light on her features.

NARRATOR: The restless energy that once propelled her, that fueled her escapism, feels… spent. The music, the parties, the augmentations – all the tools she used to outrun her fear – have proven insufficient.  She is left with the stark realization that running has led her nowhere, leaving only a trail of unfinished business and the chilling silence of a hard-won, but hollow, victory. The sun might be on, but for Crystal, the dawn feels like dusk.
