NARRATOR:  Seven days. Seven days of near-apocalyptic chaos, fueled by corporate greed and systemic failure. Seven days that ended… surprisingly well. The artificial sun, a sputtering behemoth barely clinging to life, still burns.  Crystal stands on the rooftop of her repurposed studio, the city spread beneath her like a fractured circuit board.  The air hums with a fragile peace, a tense quietude after the storm.  Below, the remnants of the rebellion – a ragtag group of musicians, augmented artists, and disillusioned Helios employees – are still gathering, their faces etched with a mixture of relief and wary optimism.

CRYSTAL: (To herself, a low hum of satisfaction mixing with a nervous tremor)  SUN_ON.  Who’d have thought?  Even *I* didn’t think I could pull that off.  Not without, you know… completely losing it.  (A faint, almost imperceptible laugh)  Guess some things are better left unprocessed. For now.

# IMAGE: Crystal silhouetted against the glowing artificial sun, a faint smile on her lips as she looks over the city below. The cityscape reflects the chaos that has passed, but also hints at a new hope forming in the aftermath of the rebellion.  Her augmented clothing features small, almost hidden, coded symbols that still subtly glimmer.

NARRATOR:  The victory feels… strangely muted.  The sun's continued operation is a fragile testament to a collective effort, a patchwork held together by sheer luck and the last-minute interventions of others.  The systemic rot remains, a festering wound beneath a thin veneer of success. But for the first time, Crystal feels a connection beyond the fleeting thrill of a party, a responsibility that transcends her immediate desires. The music, once her escape, now feels like a tool, a way to build something that lasts, something stronger than the fleeting highs she once chased.

CRYSTAL:  (Into a microphone, her voice amplified to reach the crowd below) Alright, Southpoint! Let's make some noise for the sun, for ourselves, for tomorrow. We got work to do.  This ain't over, but for tonight...let's celebrate.  And then we fix this mess.  Seriously, this time.  (A genuine smile spreads across her face, a smile that holds both exhaustion and determination).

# IMAGE: A wide shot showing Crystal on the rooftop addressing a large crowd in the streets below. Her expression is a confident but serious mix of exhaustion and hope. The crowd is a diverse mix of people, but a united sense of determination is palpable.

NARRATOR: The music begins, a raw, powerful sound that speaks of survival, resilience, and the tentative promise of a better future.  The next gig?  Building a better Ita.  One song at a time.
