NARRATOR: The cold pressed against Crystal's skin, a stark contrast to the residual heat of the ruined Exotope Refinery.  The city was plunged into an unnatural twilight, the artificial sun a forgotten memory.  A faint, rhythmic pulse – the city's emergency power grid – thrummed beneath her feet.  Her latest track, a chaotic symphony of anxiety and defiance, still played on repeat in her augmented visor, a mocking soundtrack to the encroaching darkness.

CRYSTAL: (To herself, a brittle laugh escaping her lips)  So, this is it, huh?  The big finale.  No encore.  Guess even my killer beats couldn’t outshine a dead star.  

NARRATOR:  The data leak had made waves, a ripple of disruption in Helios's carefully constructed facade.  But it wasn't enough.  The systemic rot – the greed, the negligence, the deliberate delays – had overwhelmed any individual act of defiance, leaving Ita in a state of precarious darkness.  Crystal had exposed Helios’s corruption, but the damage was done. Southpoint was as chaotic as ever, but now, crippled by the lack of power.

CRYSTAL: (Muttering, eyes fixed on the distant, inky sky)  Should have… should have done more.  Maybe.  But honestly?  Another party, another gig – it always felt like there would be time.  Always something better just around the corner.  Guess I was wrong about that.

NARRATOR:  The familiar pang of anxiety, usually drowned out by the next thrill, was a dull ache now.  But alongside it, a flicker of something else – a stubborn refusal to let the darkness win.  She wouldn't succumb to despair; her compulsion for the next experience might be misguided, but it was still a driving force.  

CRYSTAL: (Eyes hardening with a new resolve) Okay, new plan.  Let's find a generator.  And maybe some damn good speakers. This isn’t over.

# IMAGE: Crystal, silhouetted against the dark cityscape, her augmented visor glowing faintly, clutching a small, salvaged energy cell.  A determined expression sets her features in sharp contrast to the oppressive darkness.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Crystal’s augmented visor, displaying a rapidly evolving waveform – a new track taking shape, a furious, defiant energy pulsed through the complex patterns.  The title, barely visible, reads: "Ita's Requiem".
