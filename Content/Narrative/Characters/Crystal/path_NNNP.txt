NARRATOR: The sun flickers violently, casting Southpoint in strobe-like light.  Another blackout looms, and the usual thrill of chaos feels different today; a cold dread seeps in under the adrenaline.  Crystal knows she needs to do *something*, but the sheer scale of the problem is almost paralyzing.  But hey, there's always a party, right?  Wrong.  Maybe not.
