NARRATOR: The flickering sun casts long, distorted shadows across Southpoint.  The air crackles with a nervous energy – the exotope shortage is hitting hard, and the protests are getting louder. Crystal, however, is focused on something else entirely: a massive rave happening tonight in the abandoned Helios rig district.  This could be the biggest gig of her career, a perfect distraction from the dying sun and the impending doom.

  ACTION_TO_ATTEMPT_TEXT: "Secure a last-minute sponsorship deal from a shady tech company known for its experimental energy drinks and augments, hoping it will provide the resources and gear needed to make this rave an unforgettable spectacle – ignoring the ethical concerns regarding their practices."

    NARRATOR:  The deal closes – a whirlwind of promises, handshakes, and barely-legal energy drinks. Crystal secures top-of-the-line audio-visual equipment, enough to power a small city. The rave is legendary.

    NARRATOR: The shady tech company pulls out at the last minute, leaving Crystal stranded with a half-finished setup and a furious crowd.  The rave is a disaster. The weight of her avoidance catches up to her, making the sun's dimming a stark reality.
