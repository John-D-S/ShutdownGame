NARRATOR: The flickering sun casts long, eerie shadows across Southpoint's already chaotic streets.  The air crackles with a nervous energy – a mix of fear and defiant revelry. Crystal, fueled by cheap synth-ale and a frantic need to avoid confronting the dimming light, feels the familiar pull of her compulsion.  She needs a distraction, something BIG.
