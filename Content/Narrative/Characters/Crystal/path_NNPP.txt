NARRATOR: The artificial sun sputters, casting long, flickering shadows across Southpoint's neon-drenched alleys.  Crystal, perched atop a Helios extraction rig, feels the familiar thrum of anxiety – but it's overshadowed by the electrifying buzz of the impending chaos.  Tonight, she's got a plan.

TOKEN_CHALLENGE_START
  ACTION_TO_ATTEMPT_TEXT: "Organize a massive, impromptu concert/protest at the Helios headquarters, using amplified sonic weaponry and dazzling light shows to disrupt Helios operations and draw attention to their negligence in the sun crisis."
  POSITIVE_PATH_OUTCOME_TEXT_START
    NARRATOR: The concert is a roaring success, a defiant wave of sound and light that overwhelms the Helios security forces and temporarily shuts down their operations. News of the protest spreads like wildfire, exposing Helios's greed to the whole city.  The authorities, overwhelmed and fearing further escalation, are forced to negotiate.

    NARRATOR: The protest attracts attention, but not the kind Crystal hoped for.  Helios’ heavily armed security forces brutally crack down on the gathering, their superior firepower quickly dispersing the crowd. Crystal's equipment is destroyed, and she's left bruised and alone, her defiance met with swift, overwhelming force. The incident is quickly suppressed, with little long-term impact.
