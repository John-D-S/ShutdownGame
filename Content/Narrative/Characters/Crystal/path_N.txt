NARRATOR: The rhythmic pulse of Crystal's latest track, a frantic blend of synth and distorted vocals, does little to mask the growing unease.  The sun’s dimming is undeniable now, even through the haze of Southpoint's neon-drenched nights.  She needs a distraction, a rush – something to obliterate the creeping dread.

The close call only intensifies her underlying fear of the sun's impending failure.
