NARRATOR: The air in Crystal's apartment hangs heavy with the dimming light.  Another frantic message flashes across her augmented visor â€“ Sun Island's automatons are sounding the alarm, but the PSN feed is still downplaying the crisis.  She needs a distraction, a new thrill...and maybe a way to leverage this chaos into her next big gig.

  ACTION_TO_ATTEMPT_TEXT: "Crash Helios's private party at the Skydeck, hoping to snag some exclusive intel (and maybe a killer performance opportunity) from their executives, while simultaneously attempting to subtly leak some of the unfiltered Sun Island automaton messages to the wider Southpoint network."

    NARRATOR:  Crystal, disguised in a shimmering, gravity-defying outfit, infiltrates the party with her usual charm and a cleverly disguised data-stream embedded in her sonic augmentations.  She manages to subtly broadcast the raw automaton warnings during a dazzling, impromptu performance, sowing seeds of panic among Helios's less-loyal employees.

    NARRATOR:  Crystal's attempt to infiltrate the party is thwarted. Helios's security, alerted to her presence (or perhaps a poorly-timed augmented malfunction), detains her.  Her data-stream attempt is detected and quickly scrubbed, leaving the warnings undelivered.
    # IMAGE: Crystal restrained by Helios security guards in a harshly lit interrogation room, her glittery outfit now rumpled and her expression one of frustrated defiance.
