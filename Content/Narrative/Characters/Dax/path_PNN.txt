NARRATOR: The PSN's contradictory statements about the sun's status are infuriatingly opaque.  Dax suspects deliberate misinformation, a carefully constructed fog obscuring the true extent of the crisis. He needs verifiable data, not political spin.

  ACTION_TO_ATTEMPT_TEXT:  "Infiltrate the PSN's main server farm in Midcove, bypassing their security protocols and accessing raw sensor data from SebSA in Seaburn, the agency directly monitoring the artificial sun."

    NARRATOR:  Dax exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in the PSN's firewall, a ghost in the machine he'd discovered months ago during a routine audit. Raw sensor data streams in, revealing the true, horrifyingly precise rate of exotope depletion.
    # IMAGE: A chaotic but beautiful visualization of data streams flowing onto Dax's multiple monitors, highlighting the dwindling exotope reserves in sharp red against a background of cooler blues and greens representing the sun's energy output.  Each data point is meticulously labeled and categorized.

    NARRATOR: Dax's intrusion triggers a sophisticated countermeasure. The PSN's security systems not only shut down the compromised access point, but also initiate a system-wide lockdown, encrypting all sensitive data and wiping Dax's temporary access points.  He's left with nothing but a growing sense of dread.
