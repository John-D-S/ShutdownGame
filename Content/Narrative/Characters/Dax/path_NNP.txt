NARRATOR: The PSN's contradictory statements about the sun's status are a cacophony of noise, a maddening echo of the information vacuum that killed his sister. Dax feels the familiar dread rising, a cold wave of helplessness threatening to overwhelm him. He needs clarity, absolute certainty, even if it means venturing into forbidden territory.

    NARRATOR: Dax's intrusion triggers a sophisticated countermeasure; the PSN's security systems lock down, erasing all traces of his access and initiating a system-wide data purge. He's left with nothing but the chilling realization that some secrets are meant to stay buried. The fear of the unknown, amplified, closes in.
    # IMAGE: A darkened screen displaying a single, ominous message: "ACCESS DENIED. SYSTEM PURGE INITIATED." Dax's silhouette is slumped in his chair, hands hanging limply.
