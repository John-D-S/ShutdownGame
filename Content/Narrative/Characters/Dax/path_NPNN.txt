NARRATOR: The artificial sun shudders, plunging Midcove into another agonizing flicker. Dax, hunched over his multi-monitor array, feels the familiar icy grip of helplessnessâ€”a phantom echo of his sister's death.

  ACTION_TO_ATTEMPT_TEXT: "Bypass the PSN's main firewall and upload a compressed archive of raw sensor data from the SebSA sun monitors directly to the global dark web, hoping to circumvent the information blackout and trigger an independent, decentralized response."
