    NARRATOR: Dax navigates the PSN's labyrinthine security protocols with practiced ease, exploiting known vulnerabilities and leaving no trace. A trove of suppressed data spills into his encrypted archive – a chilling tapestry of corporate negligence and deliberate obfuscation. The sheer volume of evidence confirming his suspicions brings a grim satisfaction, a fleeting respite from the encroaching dread.

His access is cut off abruptly, leaving him with nothing but fragmented data and a burning sense of frustration – the vacuum of ignorance threatening to swallow him whole.  He's left with more questions than answers, and the sun's dimming becomes a tangible representation of his failure.
    # IMAGE: A screen displaying a stark "ACCESS DENIED" message, Dax's face illuminated by the flickering emergency lights.  His hands are clenched, his expression one of frustrated rage.
