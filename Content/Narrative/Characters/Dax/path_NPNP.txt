NARRATOR: The artificial sun sputters, casting long, distorted shadows across Dax's cluttered Midcove apartment.  The PSN's lies are thinner than ever; the flickering data streams reflect the dying star itself.  He knows he needs to act, to pierce the veil of misinformation before it's too late.

  ACTION_TO_ATTEMPT_TEXT: Dax will attempt to anonymously leak the PSN's falsified sun-stability data to a trusted, independent journalist contact in Seaburn, exposing the extent of the network's manipulation and hopefully triggering a more accurate public response. He will use a carefully crafted, untraceable encrypted channel and a decoy network to mask his location and protect his identity.

    NARRATOR: Dax's encrypted channel is intercepted.  The PSN, already on high alert, traces the leak back to him.  The consequences are swift and brutal: his apartment is raided, his systems wiped clean, and he is left adrift in a sea of uncertainty, the chilling realization that even his meticulously crafted anonymity failed him. The horrifying silence of ignorance threatens to return.
