  ACTION_TO_ATTEMPT_TEXT: "Infiltrate the PSN's central server farm, bypassing their layered security protocols to access their unfiltered, raw data logs on the solar energy readings and the automatons' resource requests. This requires exploiting a known vulnerability in their outdated firewall, but it's his only chance to get a complete picture of the situation before the situation gets worse."

    NARRATOR: Dax's intrusion triggers a sophisticated counter-intrusion protocol, shutting down the server farm and initiating a system-wide lockdown. The PSN’s security logs are wiped, and his unauthorized access is logged. He gains nothing but a heightened sense of dread and a confirmation of his worst fears.
    # IMAGE: A darkened room, only the faint red glow of emergency lights illuminating Dax’s frustrated and defeated figure.  His monitors are blank, leaving him in a digital void.
