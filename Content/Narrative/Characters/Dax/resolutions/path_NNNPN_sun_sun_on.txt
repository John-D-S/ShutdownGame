NARRATOR: Dax sits alone in his Midcove apartment, the artificial sun, a sickly yellow orb outside his window, casting an unsettling glow on the mountains of data surrounding him.  Seven days. Seven days of frantic digital spelunking, of chasing shadows in the labyrinthine depths of the PSN.  The sun is still shining, a testament to the resilience of others—others he refused to trust, others whose efforts he dismissed as naive or inefficient while he clung to his obsessive pursuit of knowledge. A bitter irony. The official PSN reports, still scrubbed clean of the truth, blare from a monitor he hasn't touched in hours.

DAX: (Muttering to himself, eyes glued to a single, outdated sensor reading)  Stable…for now.  A fragile stability bought with the actions of fools…or perhaps, heroes.  It doesn't matter. The core data is still there.  Hidden, but there. I know this.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Dax's screen displaying a single, almost insignificant data point amidst a sea of seemingly innocuous information.  His expression is a blend of weary exhaustion and grim satisfaction; a subtle but palpable undercurrent of regret hides beneath the surface.


NARRATOR: The weight of his failure presses down on him—the information he painstakingly gathered, the knowledge that could have saved Ita, remains locked within his own digital fortress, inert and useless.  His compulsion, the need to know, has triumphed over the need to act.  The sun shines, but the shadow of his sister’s death, and his own inaction, stretches long and dark across his soul. The clarity he craves remains elusive, replaced by a gnawing sense of his own complicity in Ita's near-destruction.

DAX: (Whispering, almost inaudible)  Another vacuum…but this time, the silence is deafening.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Dax's apartment, the artificial sun casting long, distorted shadows across his cluttered workspace, highlighting the immense volume of data that remains untouched, unshared, and ultimately, useless. The overall feeling is one of oppressive loneliness and the crushing weight of consequence.
