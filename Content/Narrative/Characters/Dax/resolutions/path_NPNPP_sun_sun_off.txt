NARRATOR: Seven days. Seven days of relentless pursuit, of piercing the layers of deceit woven by the PSN.  Dax sits amidst the wreckage of his apartment, the faint scent of burnt electronics hanging in the air.  The rhythmic beep of his remaining monitors – stripped down to essential system diagnostics – is the only sound in the suffocating darkness.  The artificial sun is dead.  The city outside is plunged into an unnerving twilight.

DAX: (Muttering to himself, eyes fixed on a fluctuating power grid display)  3.75... not enough.  Not enough to hold back the tide.  The exotope failures... ColCorp, Lumina...  Even with the PSN's lies exposed, it was a dam break too late.  The data was there, the truth was out.  But the sheer inertia…the systemic rot…

# IMAGE: A close-up of Dax's face, etched with exhaustion but strangely calm. The glow from his monitor reflects a faint, almost imperceptible glimmer in his eyes; a reflection of the information clarity he found – the clarity that is, for now, a small counterpoint to the overwhelming darkness.

NARRATOR:  The newsfeeds are a maelstrom of panic, blame, and desperate appeals for some miracle solution.  Dax ignores them.  His core urge, the terrifying void of ignorance, is momentarily quelled.  He achieved clarity; he exposed the lie. But the victory is bittersweet, tinged with the bitter taste of insufficient action.  The knowledge is cold comfort against the encroaching dark. He feels the familiar compulsion stirring again, but this time, it's not focused on the immediate crisis; it's broader, deeper.  It’s the vast, shadowy systems that allowed this to happen.  The vastness of it, the sheer scale of systemic failure…that is the new unknown he must now confront.

DAX: (A low, almost inaudible sigh)  There are other systems.  Other secrets.  The work...it continues.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Dax's apartment, now stripped down to the bare essentials.  His remaining monitors display only critical system data, a stark contrast to the chaotic mess of previous days.  But the darkness outside and the quiet intensity in his eyes hint at the immense challenge ahead.
