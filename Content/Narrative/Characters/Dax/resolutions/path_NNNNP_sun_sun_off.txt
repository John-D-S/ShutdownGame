NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dark void in the inky sky, mirrored the emptiness Dax felt. Seven days. Seven days of relentless digital pursuit, culminating in the brutal, undeniable truth he'd unearthed.  He'd exposed the PSN's lies, the collusion of Helios and Lumina RRM, the systemic failures that had choked the life from Ita's sun. Yet, the victory felt hollow, a bitter taste of clarity amidst overwhelming despair.  The terabytes of data, the meticulously documented evidence—it was all inert.

DAX: (Muttering to himself, his gaze fixed on a flickering monitor displaying the final sun sensor readings.)  -3.25... a precise quantification of failure.  They didn’t care. They wouldn't have listened.  Even with proof, inaction... inertia... it's always the same. The darkness wins.  It always wins.

# IMAGE: Dax sits alone in his darkened apartment, the only light emanating from his numerous monitors, which now display a chaotic mix of error messages, empty data streams, and the cold, black void where the sun used to be. The room is littered with discarded data packs and empty energy bars.

NARRATOR: The weight of his sister's death, the fear of that initial helplessness, pressed down on him.  He'd sought to control the unknown through knowledge, to build an impenetrable fortress of information.  But even his perfect clarity hadn't changed the outcome. The truth, he realized, was often powerless. The only victory was the momentary banishment of the darkness—a fleeting reprieve he'd gained, yet again, at the cost of everything.


# IMAGE: A close-up of Dax's hand, trembling slightly as he reaches for a data stick—the one containing the irrefutable proof of the conspiracy. His expression is a mix of exhaustion, resignation, and a chilling, almost imperceptible flicker of something akin to satisfaction.  The background is the dark, lifeless sky of Ita.

DAX: (Whispers) Another archive... another piece of the puzzle.  Perhaps, in some other life…  but not this one. Not this time. The data remains.  For what purpose, I do not know.
