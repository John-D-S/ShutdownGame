NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a dying ember in the inky black sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across Dax's Midcove apartment.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy window, illuminating the relentless glow of his monitors—a testament to his compulsive need for data, a desperate attempt to fill the void. The silence was broken only by the rhythmic whir of cooling fans and the occasional, almost mournful, beep of a system alert.  The PSN, silent now, no longer fed him the lies; there was only the crushing weight of his failure.

DAX: (Muttering to himself, eyes glued to a graph charting the sun's final descent)  -1.35… a pathetically precise measure of my inadequacy.  All that data…  and for what?

NARRATOR:  The raw data, the truth he’d painstakingly pieced together, remained inert, a monument to his crippling inability to trust, to share.  The cascading failures of Trent, Shae, and Crystal – each a node in a system he’d only partially mapped – had overwhelmed his late, solitary intervention.  The PSN's misinformation campaign, now exposed but too late, had been the final nail in Ita's coffin. He'd achieved clarity, yes, but only in the suffocating darkness of a dying world.  The cold reality of his sister's death, the agonizing echo of helplessness, returned with a force that surpassed even the encroaching cold.

# IMAGE: Dax sits hunched over his workstation, surrounded by the flickering screens. His face, gaunt and drawn, is illuminated by the sickly green glow of the data, reflecting the desolate cityscape outside, the artificial sun a distant, dying spark in the night sky.

DAX: (A whisper, barely audible)  Another information vacuum… but this time, there’s no escaping.  No algorithm to crack, no system to penetrate… only the cold, absolute certainty of failure.

NARRATOR:  The finality of it, the irreversible consequences of his actions (or rather, inactions), pressed down on him, a weight as heavy as the encroaching darkness swallowing Ita whole. The knowledge, once a shield against the unknown, now felt like a useless burden. The clarity he craved had arrived, but it brought no solace, only the bitter taste of regret.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Dax's hand, resting on a keyboard, his fingers still, the glow of the screens reflecting in his vacant eyes; the only movement is the slight tremor of his hand.  A single tear traces a path through the grime on his cheek.
