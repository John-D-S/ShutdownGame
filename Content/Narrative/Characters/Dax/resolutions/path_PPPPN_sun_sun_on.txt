NARRATOR: Day 7.  The artificial sun, a pale imitation of the real thing, hangs in the Ita sky.  Its light, though weak, is undeniably there.  Dax sits amidst the familiar chaos of his apartment, the hum of servers a low thrum beneath the city's anxious whispers.  The initial wave of relief after his data leak has subsided, leaving a quiet, almost unnerving calm. He glances at a screen displaying a newsfeed, showing a montage of relieved citizens and cautious officials addressing the averted catastrophe.  The PSN's attempts to discredit his revelations are being met with skepticism, fueled by the undeniable evidence he provided.

DAX: (to himself, a low murmur) 3.25.  Not perfect.  Far from it.  But... sufficient.  The system is still broken.  Corrupted, fragile.  Another information vacuum waits in the wings.

# IMAGE: Dax's screen displays a fragmented map of Ita, highlighting the various city-states and their interconnectedness (or lack thereof).  Red lines represent the PSN's influence, now significantly weaker but still present. Green lines show the spread of his leaked data, reaching far but not encompassing the whole planet.


NARRATOR:  He runs a hand through his hair, the faint scent of stale coffee and static clinging to his fingers.  The fear, though muted, still lingers – a low hum beneath the surface of his exhaustion.  The victory, while undeniable, feels bittersweet. He achieved clarity, a fleeting sense of control in the face of overwhelming chaos. But the knowledge of the system's inherent fragility, its vulnerability to manipulation, and its ongoing corruption, weighs heavily.  His core urge remains.  The hunt for truth will never truly end.  But today, for now, he will allow himself a moment of what he hasn't felt for years. Rest.

DAX: (Whispering, almost to the flickering light of the sun)  For Elara… for now.
