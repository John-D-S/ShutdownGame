NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, black void in the inky sky, mirrored the emptiness Dax felt.  Seven days. Seven days he'd chased the phantom of truth through the labyrinthine digital systems of Ita, only to find the ghost of his sister's death reflected in the planet's own slow, agonizing demise.  His apartment, normally a vibrant hub of data streams, was now eerily silent, save for the rhythmic tick of the clock, each second a hammer blow against the fragile edifice of his carefully constructed composure.  He had uncovered the PSN's deception, a monumental effort that yielded only minimal impact.  His anonymous leak, a desperate whisper in the digital storm, had been lost in the cacophony of misinformation, the dying gasps of a world unwilling to accept the truth.

DAX: (Muttering to himself, eyes fixed on the black window)  Irreversible... they said it was irreversible.  But whose fault was it, really? The corporate greed? The political maneuvering? The systemic failures? Or my own… inadequacy?  I found the truth, I saw it, tasted it, but it was just another piece of data, another log entry in the endless scroll of this planet's self-destruction.  Another data point that changed nothing.

# IMAGE: Dax sits hunched in his chair, the black window reflecting his shadowed face, a single tear tracing a path through the grime on his cheek. The faint glow of emergency lights pulses intermittently, illuminating scattered data printouts detailing the PSN's manipulations.

NARRATOR:  He hadn't saved his sister. He hadn't saved Ita.  The clarity he craved, the temporary reprieve from the gnawing fear, was now a bitter pill. The information vacuum remained, a vast, echoing abyss that swallowed even the triumphant knowledge of his findings. Only the relentless, inescapable knowledge of the sun's demise served as a constant reminder of the limits of his abilities.  The cold certainty of failure was worse than the suffocating ignorance he'd fought so hard to escape. The fleeting relief, the sense of purpose he had found in his work, had finally failed to banish the darkness. 

# IMAGE: A close-up of Dax's hand, trembling slightly, reaching for a nearly empty bottle of what seems to be a sedative, while his eyes are unfocused and still staring out into the dark.

DAX: (Whispering)  Another vacuum… another lie…  Another… darkness.
