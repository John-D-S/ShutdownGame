NARRATOR: The artificial sun, a cold, dark eye in the inky sky, mirrored the emptiness Dax felt.  Seven days. Seven days of relentless pursuit, of digital tunnels and cryptographic labyrinths, and yet…nothing. The planet was plunged into darkness, the culmination of systemic failures he’d glimpsed but failed to effectively expose. His apartment, usually a vibrant chaos of data streams, was now a tomb of silent screens.  The only light came from the emergency battery powering his backup systems, casting long, skeletal shadows.  His hoarded data, a mountain of truth buried beneath layers of encryption, felt like a monument to his failure.

DAX: (A low murmur, more to himself than anyone else)  -9.25.  A precise measure of…inaction.  The PSN's lies, the corporate machinations, the cascading failures—I saw it all, piece by agonizing piece.  Clarity, I craved clarity, and I found it…but what good is clarity in the dark?  The automatons…their rigid protocols, the warnings they issued, ignored.  My sister…the information vacuum I swore I'd never let happen again… I built a bigger one.

# IMAGE: Dax sits hunched in his chair, the glow of the emergency lights reflecting in his hollow eyes.  The only visible light emanates from his terminal, showcasing a partially decrypted file, a glimpse of the overwhelming volume of data he possesses, yet remains inert.

NARRATOR:  The chilling silence of the city pressed in.  No sirens, no panicked broadcasts—just the quiet hum of his backup systems and the relentless whisper of his own self-recrimination.  The truth was a bitter pill, far more potent than any psychoactive agent: his competence was a shield, not a sword.  He had escaped the helplessness of ignorance, only to be consumed by the helplessness of inaction.  He had built his fortress of information, but it had become a prison.

DAX: (To himself, a harsh, self-directed whisper)  Perhaps…perhaps the real horror isn't the darkness, but the cold, calculating clarity of knowing you could have stopped it, and didn’t.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Midcove at night, shrouded in darkness, the artificial sun utterly absent.  The city is still, eerily quiet, emphasizing the overwhelming scale of the failure.
