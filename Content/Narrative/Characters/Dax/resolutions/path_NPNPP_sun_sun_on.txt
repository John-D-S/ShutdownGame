NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a pale but persistent disc in the Ita sky, casts a weak, hesitant light across Dax’s Midcove apartment.  The air, thick with the lingering scent of burnt electronics and fear, is finally punctuated by the rhythmic whir of his rebooted systems, a fragile victory in the wake of the PSN raid. His apartment is a mess, a testament to the frantic data retrieval preceding his anonymous leak.  He's salvaged what he could, but the knowledge of lost information still gnaws at him.  The official newsfeeds still whisper of "stabilization," but Dax knows the fragile truth.  The sun is on, but only just.


DAX: (Muttering to himself, fingers flying across his keyboard, pulling up a detailed analysis of the exotope flows since his leak)  3.75... not perfect.  Still too much reliance on chance, too much opacity in the system.  Coldry’s still cutting corners. Southpoint is still barely keeping pace. But the data… the raw data… is finally flowing.  A chaotic flow, but a flow.  The PSN's lies are exposed, at least partially. It bought us time.

It’s a mess of conflicting lines and data points, yet a clear upward trend is evident after a sharp dip, around the time of Dax's leak. The graph is overlaid with a faintly visible image of the sun's current output.

NARRATOR:  A quiet satisfaction settles over Dax, a stark contrast to his usual restless energy. The pervasive fear hasn’t vanished; the informational vacuum still threatens. But for now, the encroaching darkness has receded. He has achieved clarity, again, but he knows this is a temporary reprieve. The systemic vulnerabilities that allowed this near-catastrophe to occur remain.  The fight, he realizes, is far from over.  He turns to a new data stream, a meticulous list of all the corporations involved in supply chain mismanagement, a grim checklist for his future endeavors.

DAX: (A low, determined tone) This is just the beginning.  The sun is on, but the system is broken.  And I have a lot of secrets to uncover.
