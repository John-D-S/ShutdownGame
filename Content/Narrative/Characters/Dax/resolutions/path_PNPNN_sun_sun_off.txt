NARRATOR: Day 7.  The artificial sun, a cold, dead eye in the inky black sky, casts no light on Dax’s Midcove apartment.  The city groans under the weight of its own powerlessness, the fragmented intranets a cacophony of fear and recrimination.  Dax sits amidst his usual digital chaos, but the screens now glow with a dull, lifeless light, reflecting the world outside.  His meticulously gathered data, the fruits of his obsessive quest for clarity, feels like ash in his mouth.  The PSN's carefully constructed lies, the systemic failures he’d uncovered—they weren't just abstract data points anymore; they were the cold, hard reality of Ita’s dying breath.  His compulsive need for information hadn't saved him, or anyone.  The sense of helpless ignorance he’d fought so desperately to avoid has returned, overwhelming.

DAX: (Whispering, more to himself than anyone else)  Three sources... Helios, Lumina RRM, and... a government agency.  I knew. I *knew* this was coming.  The data… it was all there.  But clarity... it wasn't enough.  It never is.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Dax's hands, trembling slightly, resting on a keyboard littered with crumbs and half-empty energy drink cans. The screens around him display a stark, black void where once vibrant data streams flowed, the only illumination coming from the emergency lights flickering intermittently.


NARRATOR: The weight of his failure—his inability to overcome his fear of engagement, his distrust of others—crushes him. His hoarded knowledge, a testament to his obsessive pursuit of control, remains inert, a monument to his self-imposed isolation. He had sought to banish the unknown, but the darkness has consumed him, mirroring the fate of Ita. The planet’s fragmented systems, a mirror of his own fractured psyche, left him stranded in the very darkness he had feared. The sun's extinction is not just a planetary catastrophe; it’s the final, brutal confirmation of his deepest, most terrifying fear.

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Dax's apartment at night, the only light emanating from the emergency lights and the faint, eerie glow of his multiple monitors showing a blank, dark screen, mirroring the dead sun outside and the bleak emptiness inside him.  The apartment itself looks like a bunker, a fortress built against an unknown enemy, now completely and utterly useless.


DAX: (A bitter laugh, devoid of humor)  Pragmatic...  lucrative… intellectually stimulating. The lies I told myself.  My sister…  it happened again. A different kind of poison, a different kind of vacuum, but the result… the same.  Helplessness.
