NARRATOR: Dax sits amidst the wreckage of his Midcove apartment, the artificial sun long extinguished, plunging the room into an oppressive darkness punctuated only by the flickering emergency lights. Dust motes dance in the weak beams, mirroring the chaotic data streams that once filled his monitors – now silent, dark screens reflecting his own vacant stare. The air hangs heavy with the metallic tang of burnt circuitry and the lingering scent of ozone, a testament to the failed data leak and the PSN's swift, brutal countermeasures.  Outside, the sounds of panicked city-wide chaos filter through the reinforced windows; a symphony of screams, sirens, and the distant, rhythmic grinding of the automatons asserting their control.

DAX: (Whispering to himself)  -4.65... a bad outcome... but not the worst.  The worst would have been… ignorance.  The complete, paralyzing lack of information.  At least I know now.  I *saw* it. The corruption, the lies…the deliberate silencing of the truth.

NARRATOR: He touches a single, scorched data chip salvaged from the wreckage of his destroyed system, its surface scarred but still retaining a fragment of the raw PSN data— irrefutable proof of OmniSynaptic's role in Ita's demise.  A grim satisfaction flickers in his eyes, a fleeting victory in the face of utter defeat.  The compulsive need for clarity, the terror of the unknown, remains, but now it's tempered by a cold, hard acceptance.  He has achieved clarity, but at a devastating cost.  The information vacuum he fought so hard to avoid has consumed Ita, and the sun’s death is its final, desolate testament.  He knows he could have done more...should have done more...but his fear of vulnerability prevented it.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Dax's hand holding the scorched data chip, the faint glow of the emergency lights reflecting in his hollow eyes. The background is blurred, showing the devastated cityscape.

DAX: (A low, almost inaudible sigh)  It's… complete.  Finally.  There are no more secrets here.  Only the chilling certainty of…  nothingness.  

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Dax's apartment, the darkness broken only by the red emergency lights, highlighting the debris and the destroyed equipment.  The window shows the dark, lifeless landscape of Ita, devoid of the artificial sun's light.  The image is muted, conveying the sense of finality and desolation.
