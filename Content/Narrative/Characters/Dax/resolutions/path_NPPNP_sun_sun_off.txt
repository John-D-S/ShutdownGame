NARRATOR: Day 7. The artificial sun, a cold, black eye in the deepening twilight, hangs above Ita.  The city lights flickered, a feeble imitation of the warmth they'd lost. Dax sat amidst the wreckage of his apartment, data streams still cascading across his monitors, but now they displayed not the thrill of discovery, but a stark, undeniable truth. The PSN’s deception was exposed, the evidence irrefutable.  Yet, the sun remained off.

DAX: (A low murmur, almost a sigh)  Clarity... always clarity.  But this clarity... this is different.

NARRATOR: His usual restless energy was gone, replaced by a weary acceptance. The meticulously gathered data, the alliances forged—all too little, too late. Trent's failures, Shae's setbacks, Crystal's defeat—they all cascaded, overwhelming even the impact of his victory. The flood of faulty exotope canisters, the crippled supply lines, the systemic corruption – these weren't merely discrete points of failure; they were the fault lines of a civilization fractured by greed and a fear of the truth.

DAX: (To himself, voice edged with a hint of bitterness)  The ecosystem... a complex, self-destructive ecosystem.  My competence... it was not enough.  Even knowledge, complete and undeniable knowledge, couldn’t stop the fall.  

# IMAGE: A wide shot of Dax's apartment, lit only by the emergency lights and the glow of his numerous monitors. The view outside the window is shrouded in a dusky, unnatural darkness.  The monitors show a final, unchanging graph: a flat line indicating zero exotope fuel.

NARRATOR: He reached out, almost hesitantly, and touched the cold metal of a deactivated data terminal.  The compulsion remained – the desperate urge to uncover, to understand – but it felt… dulled.  Not extinguished, but tempered by the brutal reality of his limited influence. The feeling of safety he usually sought through complete information was a ghost. He had known, and knowing hadn't changed the outcome. The finality of it all settled upon him, a heavy cloak woven from loss and the cold certainty of the coming dark.

# IMAGE: A close-up of Dax's hand resting on the cold metal of the deactivated terminal. His face, partially shadowed, shows a quiet resignation, not despair, but a weary acceptance of a truth more profound than any data stream could ever reveal. The image is in muted tones, emphasizing the pervasive darkness and cold.
