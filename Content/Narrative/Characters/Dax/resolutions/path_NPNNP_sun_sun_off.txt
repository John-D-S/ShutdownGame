NARRATOR: Seven days. Seven days of frantic digital warfare against a tide of lies, a desperate scramble for truth in the face of a dying sun. Dax sits amidst the wreckage of his meticulously organized workspace, the rhythmic hum of servers replaced by a chilling silence.  The artificial sun, a once-constant companion to his relentless data streams, is gone.  The screens display a final, stark image:  the dark, lifeless void where Ita's sun once blazed.

DAX: (A low murmur, barely audible)  Encrypted confirmations...  the data’s out.  But… it’s just data.

NARRATOR: The encrypted messages, a fleeting victory, offer no solace.  His compulsion had driven him, fueled by the fear of that opaque vacuum of ignorance, to expose the PSN’s lies.  He had achieved his fleeting moments of clarity, his bursts of control. But the system remained broken, the sun extinguished.  The truth, laid bare, had changed nothing. The collective inertia, the systemic failures, the interwoven corruption – it all overwhelmed his individual efforts.  His sister's death echoes, amplified by the planetary silence.

# IMAGE:  Dax sits hunched over a darkened console, the only light source emanating from the faint glow of a single, partially functioning emergency lamp.  His face is etched with exhaustion and a profound, chilling sense of emptiness, surrounded by piles of hard drives and scattered printouts showing the evidence he gathered.


DAX: (To himself, a bitter laugh)  Pragmatic application of expertise…  lucrative, intellectually stimulating…  The lie always wins.  Clarity buys nothing.


NARRATOR: The overwhelming sense of helplessness, the familiar darkness he had fought so hard to banish, threatens to engulf him completely. The knowledge, the meticulously gathered data, feels like dust, meaningless against the vast, indifferent void of Ita's night sky.

# IMAGE: A close-up on a single monitor displaying the final, chilling image of the extinguished sun against the blackness of space. A single tear tracks down Dax's cheek. The image is sharp, stark, and overwhelmingly depressing.
