NARRATOR: The PSN's contradictory statements regarding the sun's failing fuel reserves are a smokescreen, a deliberate distortion of reality. Dax, his usual calm replaced by a simmering unease, suspects a deeper cover-up.  He needs to verify the automatons' fuel depletion warning independently.

    NARRATOR: Dax exploits a known vulnerability in SebSA's older satellite uplink protocols, cleverly masking his intrusion. The raw data confirms the automatons' dire warning: fuel reserves are critically low, far beyond what the PSN publicly admits.

    NARRATOR: Dax's intrusion triggers SebSA's advanced firewall, resulting in a temporary network lockdown and an alert sent to their security team.  His access is cut off, leaving him with nothing but suspicion and the PSN's misleading reports.
