NARRATOR: The artificial sun's erratic flickering casts long, distorted shadows across Dax's spartan Midcove apartment.  The PSN's lies are a dull ache, a constant pressure against his meticulously-constructed informational fortress.  He needs more.  He needs to know.

    NARRATOR:  A carefully crafted packet, disguised as routine maintenance data, slips past the PSN's firewalls.  The unfiltered truth – the sun's true instability, the extent of the PSN's deception – begins to spread. A wave of panic, yes, but also clarity.
    # IMAGE: A swirling vortex of data packets spreading across a map of Ita's city-states, overlaid with a graph showing the sun's declining energy output.  Dax watches, a flicker of something akin to satisfaction in his eyes.
