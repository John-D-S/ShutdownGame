Simultaneously, Shae's limited success against Lumina RRM's sabotage left vital supply lines severely constrained. Dax's revelation of the PSN's misinformation campaign, though crucial, arrived too late to counteract the widespread paralysis it had induced.  Finally, Trent's failure to counteract ColCorp's influence resulted in a constant stream of defective canisters, further undermining the already precarious fuel supply.  The cumulative effect of these individual failures overwhelmed any partial successes, leaving Ita's sun to extinguish under the weight of corporate greed, political maneuvering, and systemic information warfare. # Total Score: -1.23 (Crystal GOOD: 0.95, Shae NEUTRAL: 0.07, Dax BAD: -1.16, Trent BAD: -1.09)
GOOD,BAD,BAD,NEUTRAL: SUN_OFF | Ita's artificial sun's extinction stemmed from a confluence of individual and systemic failures.  While Crystal partially exposed Helios's corruption in Southpoint, her overall success was insufficient to guarantee a reliable exotope supply.  Simultaneously, Shae's betrayal, prioritizing personal ambition over Lumina's critical supply lines to Sun Island, effectively strangled the flow of essential resources.  Dax's late exposure of the PSN's misinformation campaign, though impactful, couldn't overcome the pervasive distrust and inaction already deeply entrenched across Ita.  Trent's failure to counter ColCorp's influence in Coldry resulted in compromised canisters, further diminishing the already precarious fuel supply. This fatal combination of unreliable resources, sabotaged logistics, delayed truth, and unchecked corporate greed plunged Ita into darkness. # Total Score: -1.24 (Crystal GOOD: 0.95, Shae BAD: -0.94, Dax BAD: -1.16, Trent NEUTRAL: -0.09)
